Shelly Sterling stated that she will fight to keep her share of the Los Angeles Clippers if the NBA forces her to sell her half of the team, and she plans to eventually divorce her estranged husband, Donald Sterling [doc1_0,doc0_0]. She told ABC News' Barbara Walters that she will challenge the NBA's decision regarding her husband's lifetime ban and questioned whether other owners would oust a husband for racial slurs [doc1_1]. The NBA's constitution states that a 3/4 vote to terminate a controlling owner's interest would automatically end all other owners' stakes, but Shelly Sterling's lawyer disputed this interpretation, arguing California law and the U.S. Constitution override the NBA's rules [doc1_9,doc1_10,doc1_7]. Shelly Sterling mentioned her estranged husband may transfer full ownership to her, though she has not discussed this with Donald Sterling [doc1_11,doc1_13]. She described the Clippers franchise as her "passion" and "legacy to her family" [doc1_2]. The NBA banned Donald Sterling for life after racist comments, leading to discussions about potential buyers like Oprah Winfrey and Magic Johnson, though no concrete ownership changes have been confirmed [doc1_4,doc1_19]. Shelly Sterling noted she had nearly filed for divorce but was advised against it due to financial arrangements, though she has been working on divorce proceedings for 20 years [doc1_15,doc1_16]. She also suggested her estranged husband may be suffering from "the onset of dementia" [doc1_18].
