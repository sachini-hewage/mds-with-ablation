Shelly Sterling stated she will eventually divorce her estranged husband, Donald Sterling, and will fight to keep her stake in the Los Angeles Clippers if the NBA forces her to sell it [doc1_0,doc0_0,doc1_15,doc0_5,doc1_17]. She emphasized the Clippers franchise is her "passion" and "legacy to her family" [doc1_2]. The NBA banned Donald Sterling for life following racist comments, and Commissioner Adam Silver imposed a $2.5 million fine [doc1_12,doc0_3,doc1_4]. Shelly Sterling said she has been with the team for 33 years, through "the good times and the bad times" [doc1_3]. She questioned whether other NBA owners would oust a husband who made racial slurs, asking, "would the owners oust the husband? Or would the owners leave the husband in?" [doc1_1]. Under the NBA Constitution, if a controlling owner's interest is terminated by a 3/4 vote, all other team owners' interests are automatically terminated [doc1_8]. Shelly Sterling's lawyer, Pierce O'Donnell, disputed the league's interpretation of the constitution, stating California law and the U.S. Constitution "trump any such interpretation" [doc1_9,doc1_10]. Shelly Sterling mentioned she signed a divorce petition but was advised against filing it "not now" due to financial considerations [doc1_15]. She also suggested Donald Sterling might transfer full ownership to her, which she "would love him to consider" [doc1_11]. Shelly Sterling said she was "shocked" by Donald's comments and does not believe she should be punished for his actions [doc1_6]. An NBA spokesman claimed league rules would not allow her to retain her share [doc1_7]. Celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and Magic Johnson have expressed willingness to buy the team, while Richard Parsons was named interim CEO [doc1_19,doc1_20]. Shelly Sterling told Barbara Walters she has "seen attorneys for a divorce" for 20 years and believes the stalling of the divorce stems from "financial arrangements" [doc1_16,doc0_5]. She also mentioned she has not discussed the divorce with Donald Sterling [doc1_13]. Additionally, Shelly Sterling suggested Donald Sterling may be suffering from "the onset of dementia" [doc1_18].
