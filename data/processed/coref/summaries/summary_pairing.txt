Shelly Sterling said she will eventually divorce her estranged husband, Donald Sterling, and that she would "absolutely" fight to keep her stake in the Los Angeles Clippers if the NBA forces her to sell her half of the team [doc1_0,doc0_0]. She made these comments in her first interview since the NBA banned Donald Sterling for making racist comments, which led to a lifetime ban and a $2.5 million fine [doc1_0,doc0_0,doc1_4]. Shelly described the Clippers franchise as her "passion" and "legacy to my family" [doc1_2]. She also stated that if the league forced Donald to sell his share, she "would love him to" transfer full ownership to her [doc1_11]. Shelly mentioned she had been working with attorneys for divorce for 20 years, though she was advised against filing due to financial considerations [doc1_15,doc1_16]. She claimed her husband is suffering from "the onset of dementia" and that the delay in divorce proceedings stems from "financial arrangements" [doc1_18,doc1_16]. Shelly questioned whether the NBA would treat other owners' wives the same if they faced similar situations [doc1_1]. An NBA spokesman said league rules would not allow her to retain her share, but her lawyer, Pierce O'Donnell, disputed this interpretation, citing California law and the U.S. Constitution [doc1_7,doc1_10]. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver named Richard Parsons interim CEO of the Clippers, though no concrete decisions about ownership or forced sales had been made [doc0_3,doc1_20]. Shelly said she would "have to accept" any punishment for Donald's actions but argued her stake should remain separate [doc1_5]. Celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and Magic Johnson have expressed interest in buying the team, though Donald Sterling remains the owner, barred from team operations [doc1_19]. Shelly stated she had not discussed the NBA's decision with Donald and that ABC News contacted him for comment, but he declined to respond [doc1_13,doc1_21].
