Shelly Sterling, co-owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, stated she will fight to keep her share of the team and plans to eventually divorce her estranged husband, Donald Sterling, though financial considerations have delayed the process [doc0_0,doc1_0,doc0_5,doc1_15,doc1_19]. She mentioned she had filed a divorce petition but was advised against proceeding by her financial advisor and attorney [doc1_15]. Sterling emphasized her deep connection to the Clippers, calling it her \"passion\" and \"legacy to my family,\" and noted she has been with the team for 33 years [doc1_2,doc1_3]. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Donald Sterling for life following racist comments, imposed a $2.5 million fine, and urged owners to force him to sell the team, though no decisions were made regarding Sterling's family [doc0_3,doc1_4,doc1_12]. Shelly Sterling told ABC News' Barbara Walters she would \"fight that decision\" and questioned whether other owners' spouses would face similar consequences if they made similar remarks [doc0_4,doc1_1]. She also suggested her husband may be suffering from \"the onset of dementia\" [doc1_18]. The NBA stated league rules would not allow Shelly to retain her share if Donald was forced to sell his stake, but her attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, disputed this interpretation, arguing California law and the U.S. Constitution override the NBA's stance [doc1_7,doc1_9,doc1_10]. If the NBA forces Donald to sell, Shelly expressed hope he might transfer full ownership to her [doc1_11]. Several celebrities, including Oprah Winfrey and Magic Johnson, have indicated willingness to buy the team [doc1_19]. Richard Parsons was named interim CEO of the Clippers, overseeing daily operations while ownership questions remained unresolved [doc1_20]. Shelly confirmed she had not discussed the situation with Donald Sterling, who declined to comment on his wife's interview [doc1_13,doc1_21]. She attributed the delay in divorce proceedings to \"financial arrangements\" [doc1_16].
