Prior to that I attended the best private art school in the nation. I’m not some flaky, disgruntled art graduate, either. I have a quite successful career, thankyouverymuch. \n \n But I am saddened and ashamed at art schools and their blatant exploitation of students. Graduates are woefully ill-prepared for the realities of being professional artists and racked with obscene amounts of debt. By their own estimation, the cost of a four year education at RISD is $245,816. As way of comparison, the cost of a diploma from Harvard Law School is a mere $236,100. \n \n This is embarrassing. It’s downright shameful. That any art school should deceive its students into believing that this is a smart decision is cruel and unusual. \n \n Artists are neither doctors nor lawyers. We do not, on average, make huge six-figure salaries. We can make livable salaries, certainly. Even comfortable salaries. But we ain’t usually making a quarter mil a year. Hate to break it to you. An online debt repayment calculator recommended a salary exceeding $400,000 in order to pay off a RISD education within 10 years. \n \n Don’t do it. \n \n Don’t start your career with debilitating debt. \n \n Please. I beg you. Think long and hard whether you’re willing to pay student loan companies $3000 every single month for the next 10 years. \n \n You’ve got other options. \n \n You don’t have to go to college to be an artist. Not once have I needed my diploma to get a job. Nobody cares. The education is all that matters. The work that you produce should be your sole concern. \n \n There are excellent atelier schools all over the world that offer superior education for a mere fraction of the price. Here are a few: \n \n There are more. Many, many more. And none of them will cost nearly as much as a traditional four year school. \n \n And then there are the online options. The availability of drawing and painting resources is incredible. \n \n Sitting at a computer I have direct access to artists all over the world. I have the combined wisdom of the artistic community to pull from at my leisure. For less than a few grand a year I can view more educational material than I would see at any art school. You can get a year of access to all of the Gnomon Workshop’s videos for the cost of a few days at the average art school. \n \n With all of these options it can be a little daunting.
