Shelly Sterling said she will eventually divorce her estranged husband, Donald Sterling, and if the NBA forces her to sell her half of the Los Angeles Clippers, she would "absolutely" fight to keep her stake in the team [doc1_0]. This statement comes after the NBA banned Donald Sterling for life following racist comments, which were caught on tape and released to the media, leading to a $2.5 million fine [doc1_4]. In her first interview since the ban, Shelly Sterling told ABC News' Barbara Walters she would "fight that decision" and questioned whether other owners' spouses who made similar remarks would face the same consequences [doc1_1,doc0_0]. She described the Clippers franchise as her "passion" and "legacy to my family" [doc1_2]. The NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has urged owners to force Donald Sterling to sell the team, though no decisions have been made about the rest of his family [doc0_3]. Shelly Sterling stated she would "have to accept" any punishment handed down to her husband but emphasized her stake in the team should remain separate [doc1_5]. An NBA spokesman said league rules would not allow her to hold on to her share [doc1_7]. Shelly Sterling's attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, disputed the league's interpretation of its constitution, arguing that California law and the U.S. Constitution override the NBA's rules [doc1_10]. She also mentioned that she thinks Donald Sterling is suffering from "the onset of dementia" and that the stalling of their divorce stems from "financial arrangements" [doc1_18,doc1_16]. Shelly Sterling said she "was shocked by what he said" and expressed uncertainty about why she should be punished for her husband's actions [doc1_6]. If the league forces Donald Sterling to sell his half of the team, Shelly Sterling said she "would love him to" consider transferring full ownership to her [doc1_11]. Several celebrities, including Oprah Winfrey and Magic Johnson, have expressed willingness to buy the team, though Donald Sterling remains the owner but is barred from involvement in team operations [doc1_19]. NBA spokesman Mike Bass explained that under the NBA Constitution, if a controlling owner's interest is terminated by a 3/4 vote, all other team owners' interests are automatically terminated as well [doc1_8]. Shelly Sterling mentioned she had previously filed for divorce but was advised by her financial advisor and attorney to delay it [doc1_15]. The lack of communication between Shelly and Donald Sterling led Walters to question whether she plans to file for divorce [doc1_14]. Richard Parsons has been named interim CEO of the team, overseeing daily operations while no concrete decisions about ownership have been made [doc1_20]. ABC News contacted Donald Sterling for comment on his wife's interview, but he declined [doc1_21].
