Shelly Sterling said she will eventually divorce her estranged husband, Donald Sterling, and would fight to keep her stake in the Los Angeles Clippers if the NBA forces her to sell it [doc1_0,doc0_0]. She described the Clippers franchise as her "passion" and "legacy to my family" [doc1_2]. Shelly stated she had not yet filed for divorce due to financial considerations but mentioned she "had to accept" any punishment the NBA imposed on Donald Sterling, emphasizing her stake should remain separate [doc0_5,doc1_5]. The NBA banned Donald Sterling for life after racist comments, fining him $2.5 million, and urged owners to force him to sell the team [doc0_3,doc1_4]. An NBA spokesman claimed league rules would require terminating Shelly's ownership if Donald's stake was removed, but her lawyer disputed this, arguing California law and the U.S. Constitution override the NBA's interpretation [doc1_7,doc1_9,doc1_10]. Shelly mentioned she had been seeing attorneys for divorce for 20 years but postponed filing due to financial advice [doc1_15]. She also suggested Donald Sterling might be suffering from "the onset of dementia" [doc1_18]. Shelly told Barbara Walters she would "fight that decision" and questioned whether other owners' spouses making similar remarks would face the same consequences [doc1_3,doc0_4,doc1_1]. Celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and Magic Johnson have expressed willingness to buy the team, though no concrete ownership changes have been confirmed [doc1_19]. Richard Parsons was named interim CEO of the Clippers, overseeing daily operations while ownership issues remain unresolved [doc1_20]. Shelly noted she had not discussed the NBA's decision with Donald Sterling [doc1_13]. The Clippers co-owner watched a game with her attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, during the Western Conference playoffs [doc0_1].
