NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Donald Sterling for life and urged owners to force him to sell the team following racist comments, which were recorded and released to the media on April 29, resulting in a $2.5 million fine [doc8_0_0,doc8_1_0,doc8_2_0].

The NBA stated league rules would not allow Shelly to retain her share if Donald is forced to sell his stake, though Shelly's lawyer, Pierce O'Donnell, disputed the league's interpretation of the NBA Constitution [doc1_7_0,doc7_0_0,doc7_1_0]. Shelly noted that if Donald is required to sell his half of the team, she "would love him to" transfer full ownership to her [doc1_11_0]. Celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Magic Johnson have expressed willingness to buy the team from Sterling [doc1_19_0]. NBA spokesman Mike Bass explained that under the NBA Constitution, terminating a controlling owner's interest by a 3/4 vote would automatically terminate all other owners' interests [doc6_0_0,doc6_1_0]. Shelly's attorney argued that California law and the U.S. Constitution override the NBA's interpretation of its rules [doc1_10_1,doc1_10_2]. Richard Parsons has been named interim CEO of the Clippers, overseeing daily operations while no concrete decisions about ownership changes have been made [doc5_0_0,doc5_1_0].
