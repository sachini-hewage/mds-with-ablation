Shelly Sterling stated she will fight the NBA's decision to ban her estranged husband, Donald Sterling, and plans to keep her share of the Los Angeles Clippers, asserting her stake should be separate from his punishment [doc0_0,doc1_0,doc1_1,doc1_5]. She emphasized the Clippers franchise is her "passion" and "legacy to my family" [doc1_2]. The NBA claimed league rules would not allow her to retain her share, stating that if a controlling owner's interest is terminated by a 3/4 vote, all other team owners' interests are automatically terminated [doc1_7,doc1_8].

Shelly mentioned she "eventually" will divorce Donald Sterling, though financial considerations have delayed the process [doc0_5,doc1_16,doc1_17]. She revealed she had nearly filed for divorce but was advised against it by her financial advisor and attorney [doc1_15]. Shelly also suggested Donald Sterling may be suffering from "the onset of dementia" [doc1_18].
