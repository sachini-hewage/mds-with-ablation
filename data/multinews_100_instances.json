    "document": "LUMBERTON, N.C. (WNCN) — In Spring 2017, three women were found dead in a matter of weeks in Lumberton. \n \n Their deaths captured the public’s attention, drawing federal scrutiny and international press coverage and fueling rumors that a serial killer was on the loose. Much of the discussion of the killings has been speculation about links between deaths and disappearances in the area. Here’s what we actually know. \n \n WHAT WE KNOW \n \n Three women were found dead. On April 18, 2017, Christina “Kristin” Bennett, 32, was found dead at 505 Peachtree St. in Lumberton. The same day, Rhonda Jones, 36, was found at 702 East Fifth St. The two sites are only yards apart. \n \n Peachtree Street is a narrow dirt track that runs along some railroad tracks. At the time, the bodies were described as decomposed. \n \n On June 3, 2017, Megan Ann Oxendine, 28, was found decomposed behind a vacant home at 608 E. Eighth Street. That’s about three blocks up the railroad tracks from where the first two bodies were found. \n \n One of the bodies was found somewhere unusual. Jones’ body was found in a trash can, police said at the time. \n \n There’s a connection between at least two of the dead women. Oxendine was friends with Jones, and spoke with CBS North Carolina about Jones’ death. \n \n Oxendine spoke with CBS North Carolina on April 19. Her decomposed body was found just a little more than six weeks later. \n \n Police are investigating with the help of the FBI. The State Bureau of Investigation was called in to assist on the case almost immediately, and the FBI has been helping for months. \n \n Authorities are offering a reward. On Wednesday, FBI and police officials held a press conference to announce a reward of up to $30,000 for information that helps them “determine the circumstances that lead to the deaths.” \n \n The reward is helping. “Information is starting to move after offering the reward,” said Capt. Terry Parker of the Lumberton police on Thursday. \n \n Another woman disappeared. Abby Patterson was last seen on Sept. 5, 2017, when she got a ride from an acquaintance. She texted her mother to say she’d be gone for about an hour, but was never heard from again. There is a $5,000 reward for information that leads to Patterson. \n \n These aren’t the only crimes that have happened in Lumberton lately. There have been a number of other violent crimes in Lumberton, but they haven’t gotten nearly the attention that the three dead women and Abby Patterson have. For example, there’s a $5,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest in the killing of Warren Bradford Fields, 38. Fields was shot and killed inside his camper in Lumberton Nov. 7, 2017. Also in November, police started a homicide investigation, after finding a man’s decomposed body in a wooded area. Before those and other crimes, the town was in the news at the end of 2016 after a town police car was set on fire for the third time in one year. The ATF is involved in that case. \n \n WHAT WE DON’T KNOW \n \n We don’t know how the women died. Neither do officials. The medical examiner hasn’t yet determined a cause of death, Lumberton Police Chief Michael McNeill said Wednesday. While investigators are remaining tight-lipped, figuring out how the three died seems to be a big part of the ongoing investigation. \n \n We don’t know if there’s been a crime. “At this point, we do not know if this is a criminal matter, or whether there’s another explanation for why these women are gone,” McNeill said Wednesday. \n \n We don’t know where Abby Patterson is. Police say they’re making progress in the case, but it’s slow going. \n \n We don’t know which deaths are actually connected. “We don’t know that these deaths are necessarily linked,” said John A. Strong, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Charlotte Division. “They have some similarities.” Those similarities include the times and places the bodies were found. Strong said he’s not at liberty to discuss any other similarities. He also said There’s no indication the three women’s deaths are linked to any other deaths. \n \n WHAT OTHERS ARE CLICKING ON: ||||| It's been seven months since the bodies of three women were found just weeks apart within a four-block radius in North Carolina, and investigators still don't have answers about what happened to them. \n \n The FBI on Wednesday announced a reward of up to $30,000 for information that helps investigators determine the circumstances that led to the deaths of Christina Bennett, Rhonda Jones and Megan Oxendine in Lumberton, a city located some 95 miles south of the state's capital. \n \n Bennett was found dead inside a house on Peachtree Street on April 18, 2017. Jones' body was found outside a house on East 5th Street on the same day. \n \n Oxendine was found dead outside a house on East 8th Street on June 3, 2017. That month, the Lumberton Police Department requested assistance from the FBI in the three separate death investigations. \n \n A cause of death has not yet been determined for any of the women, according to the FBI. \n \n FBI \n \n Authorities on Wednesday urged anyone who came into contact with the women to come forward to help investigators create a timeline of when and where they were last seen alive. \n \n “Every part of our work as law enforcement benefits from help we receive from the public. We need the community’s assistance, the people’s eyes and ears, information from friends and neighbors,\" John Strong, special agent in charge of the FBI in North Carolina, said in a statement. \"So we ask you to pick up the phone and call us. Tell us what you know, what you heard, and what you saw.\" \n \n Lumberton Police Chief Michael McNeill previously said it was unclear whether there is a connection between the three deaths, which have haunted the community. \n \n “As police chief and as a member of this community, I want to know what happened to Christina, Rhonda and Megan. I also understand there is a lot of uncertainty, concern and even fear right now,\" McNeill said in a statement Wednesday. \"Let me reassure you that we are committed to finding out the answers. We hope the people of Lumberton will help us.\" \n \n Anyone with information regarding when and where the women were last seen is asked to call the FBI's Charlotte field office at 704-672-6100 and select option no. 2. ||||| A $10,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the whereabouts of a woman who disappeared nearly two months ago after leaving her family's rural North Carolina home. \n \n Abby Patterson, 20, told her mother she'd return in an hour when she left her Lumberton, N.C., home on Sept. 5 and stepped into an old brown Buick driven by a \"male acquaintance,\" according to police. She has not been seen or heard from since. \n \n Patterson vanished from the same area where three other women were found dead within the last six months -- though authorities do not believe there is a connection between Patterson and the victims. \n \n \"Anything is possible but we do not think they're related,\" Lumberton Police Capt. Terry Parker told Fox News on Wednesday. \n \n The Robesonian newspaper reported that an increased reward of $10,000 is being offered for any tips leading to the location of Patterson, who had just been released from a drug rehabilitation center at the time of her disappearance. \n \n A local chicken-processing facility is adding $5,000 to the reward money already being offered by the woman's family, Patterson's sister, Sandy Bryan, told the newspaper. \n \n \"We know she's not out there by choice,\" Bryan said. \"She talks to my mom every day, and we haven’t heard from her since (she was seen getting into the Buick).\" \n \n Investigators discovered the body of Christina Bennett, 32, on April 18 inside an abandoned home in Lumberton — a city of close to 22,000 people in Robeson County. That same day, the remains of Rhonda Jones were found in a nearby trash container. \n \n Neighborhood resident 28-year-old Megan Oxendine was interviewed by a local news station at the time Jones' body was discovered. Weeks later, on June 3, Oxendine's remains were found about 500 feet away from where the other bodies were found. \n \n There were no obvious signs of trauma to the victims, and police are still waiting for official autopsy reports from the state Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Raleigh. \n \n An FBI spokeswoman previously confirmed to Fox News that the bureau is assisting local police with the death investigations. \n \n Patterson is described as 5 feet, 7 inches tall and weighing 140 pounds, with brown hair and eyes. She has light skin, with a birthmark on the back of her left thigh and a bird tattoo on her shoulder. \n \n In the case of Patterson, police said they have identified the man last seen with the young woman, who was living in Florida and visiting her mother in Lumberton for two days when she disappeared. \n \n \"We think it’s someone she knew, but we're not sure,\" said Parker, who did not name the man or say whether he's considered a person of interest in the case. \n \n Anyone with information on Patterson's whereabouts or on the deaths of Bennett, Jones and Oxendine is urged to call the Lumberton Police Department at (910) 671-3845. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

    "summary": "– Months after three women were found dead in a four-block radius in Lumberton, NC, law enforcement officials have yet to find answers, so they're greasing the wheels. The FBI on Wednesday announced a $30,000 reward for information on the deaths of 32-year-old Christina \"Kristin\" Bennett, 36-year-old Rhonda Jones, and 28-year-old Megan Oxendine. Bennett was found dead in an abandoned home in the small city of 22,000 on April 18, 2017, the same day Jones' body was discovered outside a home 500 feet away, reports the Fayetteville Observer. Weeks later on June 3, Oxendine—a friend of Jones, per WNCN—was discovered dead behind a home three blocks from where the other women were found. At this point, officials aren't sure how the women died, or if a crime occurred, as their bodies were decomposed, report the Observer and ABC News. \"All three women were mothers. They were daughters, sisters, and aunts. They were loved and they are missed, but they are not forgotten,\" says Lumberton Police Chief Michael MacNeill, noting the decision to request additional help from the public came after \"countless hours following leads, conducting interviews and gathering evidence to determine what happened to these women.\" On Thursday, a police captain told WNCN that information is already \"starting to move after offering the reward.\" A separate $15,000 reward is offered for tips leading to missing Lumberton resident Abby Patterson, who disappeared Sept. 5, Fox News reported in November. Police previously said it was unlikely Patterson's disappearance was linked to the three women's deaths, which were followed by at least two suspected murders, per WNCN."

    "document": "LAS VEGAS—Not long after the billionaire casino mogul Steve Wynn opened his flagship Wynn Las Vegas in 2005, a manicurist who worked there arrived at the on-site salon visibly distressed following an appointment in Mr. Wynn’s office. \n \n Sobbing, she told a colleague Mr. Wynn had forced her to have sex, and she repeated that to others later. \n \n After... ||||| SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email \n \n Wynn Resorts Ltd. shares sank more than 8 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported that its founder, casino industry legend Steve Wynn, sexually harassed numerous women over many years. \n \n Wynn, also the finance chairman for the Republican National Committee, paid $7.5 million to settle claims brought by a former manicurist at his resort who said the executive pressured her to have sex with him, the Journal said. Wynn pressured massage therapists to perform sex acts for $1,000 tips, and others at the spa created fictitious appointments to avoid contact with him, said the newspaper, which contacted more than 150 people who worked with the casino magnate. \n \n Wynn, who turns 76 on Saturday, denied the allegations. “The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous,” he told the Journal. His fortune is valued at about $3.7 billion, most of it in Wynn shares, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. \n \n Steve Wynn Photographer: Jerome Favre/Bloomberg \n \n The allegations jolted a company whose reputation is synonymous with that of its founder, who starred in TV commercials with the likes of Frank Sinatra to promote his properties. \n \n Wynn Resorts fell as much as 8.2 percent to $184.13 in New York, the biggest drop since July 2017. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did the Republican National Committee, which urged the Democratic National Committee last year to return campaign donations from movie mogul Harvey Weinstein when he was accused of sexual assault. \n \n “If the DNC truly stands up for women like they say they do, then returning Weinstein’s dirty money should be a no-brainer,” RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel tweeted last year. \n \n The legal settlement detailed by the Journal in Friday’s report has become a major focus of a lawsuit between Wynn and his ex-wife Elaine Wynn, who is seeking to gain control of her 9 percent stake in the casino giant. Steve Wynn has long sought to maintain his hold over the company because he lost his previous business, Mirage Resorts, to an unsolicited bid from mogul Kirk Kerkorian. \n \n Wynn’s second-in-command and heir apparent at Wynn Resorts is Matt Maddox, a 16-year company veteran who rose from vice president of investor relations to president. Wynn is chairman of the board, whose lead director is former Nevada Governor Robert J. Miller. Maddox and Miller didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. \n \n While Wynn Resorts is based in Las Vegas, it generates more than 70 percent of its business in the Chinese gambling market of Macau. After reporting better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings this week, the company said it plans to develop the next phase of the $4.2 billion Wynn Palace there on 11 acres (4.45 hectares). \n \n The company also announced plans for a new 2,500-room property across Las Vegas Boulevard from its current towers on the site of the former Frontier casino and is constructing a new hotel, convention and lake resort behind its existing properties. \n \n — With assistance by Jennifer Epstein ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

    "summary": "– A shocking report from the Wall Street Journal emerged Friday, detailing what it says \"would amount to a decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct\" by one of Las Vegas' biggest casino moguls. Based on more than 150 interviews with past and current employees, as well as court records, the Journal reports on disturbing sexual misconduct accusations against Steve Wynn, CEO and chairman of Wynn Resorts and finance chair for the RNC. Many of the allegations revolve around incidents said to have occurred while he was receiving salon services or massages at Wynn Las Vegas, with tales of female workers hiding in the bathroom or in other areas when they heard Wynn was coming for an appointment. \"Everybody was petrified,\" says one of the salon's ex-artistic directors, who noted he and others had brought up Wynn's behavior to higher-ups but \"nobody was there to help us.\" One ex-massage therapist said Wynn pressured her into masturbating him during sessions; she says she drew the line at his oral sex requests. Meanwhile, a manicurist says she was forced to have sex with him; she reportedly received a $7.5 million settlement. Others mention incidents in which Wynn would let his genitals hang out of his shorts and proposition workers. In a statement to the Journal, Wynn, who turns 76 Saturday and has been called a \"great friend\" by President Trump, calls the allegations \"preposterous\" and points the finger at ex-wife Elaine Wynn, whom he married and divorced twice, saying a \"terrible and nasty lawsuit\" from her for a divorce payout is to blame. The Journal report made an immediate impact: Bloomberg reports Wynn Resorts shares fell more than 8% after the news hit, the largest drop since July.

    "document": "Chef Thomas Keller is known for amazing dishes at the three-Michelin-star Per Se in New York. The menu costs $325. \n \n Among the options: Oysters and pearls, a “Sabayon” of pearl tapioca with Island Creek oysters and white sturgeon caviar. Or how about the Wolfe Ranch white quail, with pumpkin purée, Medjool dates, English walnuts and toasted pumpkin seed jus at the French Laundry, in Yountville, California? \n \n To such fine creations, chef Keller has added something extra special. A new hot dog. \n \n The Thomas Keller Surf n' Turf will make its debut in December at Bubbledogs, a tiny London restaurant that serves Champagne and dogs. It's a frankfurter topped with minced Cornish lobster, dill pickle chips and celery. It will cost £12 ($14.60) and be available throughout the month. \n \n Thomas Keller. Photographer: Richard Vines/Bloomberg \n \n Bubbledogs owners Sandia Chang and James Knappett met while working at Per Se a decade ago, when he was a chef and she waited tables. They worked for Keller again when he opened the pop-up French Laundry at Harrods in London in 2011. The husband-and-wife team regularly invites chefs to create hot dogs for Bubbledogs. \n \n \"We went Americana for this dog,\" Keller said. It combines an American hot dog and a New England lobster roll. \n \n \"We start with a traditional buttered brioche, like you’d find in a New England lobster roll. We layer the bun with house-made dill pickles, and then, for the 'relish,' we top the dog with chilled lobster salad and garnish it all with micro celery leaves. \n \n \"I am a fan of both hot dogs and lobster rolls - childhood favorites, staples of sun-splashed picnics and afternoons spent at the ballpark.\" \n \n This isn't Keller's first dog. He has also developed the Yountwurst, which takes its name from the town of Yountville, home of the French Laundry as well as his Bouchon bakery and Ad Hoc casual restaurant. \n \n Chang said Keller has always been supportive, showing up within two weeks of Bubbledogs and its sister restaurant Kitchen Table opening in 2012. Other fans include Shake Shack founder Danny Meyer, who visits when in London. \n \n \"I always do my best to support our alumni when they light out on their own,\" Keller said. \n \n Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Bloomberg. Follow him on Twitter @richardvines and Instagram @richard.vines. ||||| The lady had dropped her napkin. \n \n More accurately, she had hurled it to the floor in a fit of disillusionment, her small protest against the slow creep of mediocrity and missed cues during a four-hour dinner at Per Se that would cost the four of us close to $3,000. Some time later, a passing server picked up the napkin without pausing to see whose lap it was missing from, neatly embodying the oblivious sleepwalking that had pushed my guest to this point. \n \n Such is Per Se’s mystique that I briefly wondered if the failure to bring her a new napkin could have been intentional. The restaurant’s identity, to the extent that it has one distinct from that of its owner and chef, Thomas Keller, is based on fastidiously minding the tiniest details. This is the place, after all, that brought in a ballet dancer to help servers slip around the tables with poise. So I had to consider the chance that the server was just making a thoughtful accommodation to a diner with a napkin allergy. \n \n But in three meals this fall and winter, enough other things have gone awry in the kitchen and dining room to make that theory seem unlikely. Enough, also, to make the perception of Per Se as one of the country’s great restaurants, which I shared after visits in the past, appear out of date. Enough to suggest that the four-star rating it received from Sam Sifton in 2011, its most recent review in The New York Times, needs a hard look. \n \n With each fresh review, a restaurant has to earn its stars again. In its current form and at its current price, Per Se struggled and failed to do this, ranging from respectably dull at best to disappointingly flat-footed at worst. ||||| Chef Thomas Keller’s woes don’t seem to be abating. After a scathing New York Times review for his New York City restaurant Per Se in January (and a similar review from Eater), Keller, as well as The French Laundry in Napa Valley, and the Thomas Keller Restaurant Group are all being sued for pregnancy discrimination. \n \n Filed last month in Napa Superior Court, the Napa Valley Register reports that the lawsuit alleges that Vanessa Scott-Allen was prevented from working at The French Laundry because of her pregnancy. According to the Napa Valley Register, the complaint alleges that the restaurant group had approved a transfer of her job from Per Se to The French Laundry, but when TFL found out about her pregnancy, they terminated the offer — after she had left her five-year-old serving position at Per Se and moved her family out to California. \n \n According to the Napa Valley Register, Scott-Allen claims that after a visit to TFL in January when general manager Michael Minnillo (also named in the suit) told her that the restaurant “would love” to have her work there, she approached her Per Se manager Antonio Begonja about wanting to transfer, and notified him of her pregnancy. Reportedly, the managers worked out the transfer, and Scott-Allen said she was set to work at TFL starting on April 1, before which time she terminated her lease in New York, bought a car, and found a place to live in California. \n \n Scott-Allen’s start date was allegedly pushed back to April 4, when she claims that TFL manager Olivia Wallace asked her several questions about her pregnancy and plans for maternity leave, such as her due date, how long she would work until giving birth, and how long she planned for maternity leave. After that encounter, Scott-Allen was told the position was no longer available, nor was any other position (despite there being three positions open), according to the Napa Valley Register’s account of the lawsuit. \n \n The Napa Valley Register reports that on April 21, Scott-Allen filed a complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing and received a notice of case closure and right to sue, after which she filed the lawsuit in Napa Superior Court on September 26. The article states that she is seeking $5 million in damages for fraud and deceit, sex discrimination, violation of pregnancy disability leave law, negligent misrepresentation, breach of implied contract, wrongful termination, failure to prevent discrimination, and violations of labor codes and the California Family Rights Act. A case management conference is scheduled for March 7, 2017. Scott-Allen is reportedly demanding a jury trial. \n \n Eater SF has reached out to both The Thomas Keller Restaurant Group and Scott-Allen’s attorney for comment, with no immediate response.

    "summary": "– California's French Laundry may have three Michelin stars, but it also has a discrimination lawsuit on its hands. The restaurant is accused of firing a server because she was pregnant, reports the Napa Valley Register. The suit also names chef Thomas Keller; the Thomas Keller Restaurant Group; and Keller's New York restaurant, Per Se. Server Vanessa Scott-Allen says she worked at Per Se for five years before she moved across the country to accept a gig at The French Laundry. But the job disappeared before she actually started, and Scott-Allen says that happened after a manager began asking her questions about how long she planned to be out on maternity leave. Scott-Allen is now seeking $5 million in damages for a slew of allegations, including fraud and deceit, and violation of the pregnancy disability leave law, according to her lawsuit filed last month in Napa County Superior Court. A rep for the Keller Restaurant Group says it doesn't comment on pending lawsuits. The suit comes at a rough time for Keller, notes Eater, given that a New York Times food critic delivered a scathing review of Per Se earlier this year. Bloomberg, meanwhile, notes that he's branching into fancy hot dogs in London. (Thieves once stole $300,000 in wine from The French Laundry.)"

Solutions have been found for numerous questions. We are still working on two or three issues... The talks are in their final phase and are very difficult,\" Abbas Araqchi told reporters in Lausanne. \n \n Araqchi said Sunday that sending abroad its stocks of nuclear material, a key demand of world powers in talks in Switzerland, was unacceptable. \n \n \"The export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our programme and we do not intend sending them abroad... There is no question of sending the stocks abroad,\" Araqchi told reporters. ||||| There’s a strong relationship between America and Israel. They are an important ally, and we will continue to work towards strengthening that relationship. Posted by Speaker John Boehner on Monday, March 30, 2015 \n \n In an interview with Dana Bash airing on CNN’s “State of the Union” this morning, House Speaker John Boehner discussed a range of issues, including this week’s House-passed bill to strengthen Medicare and protect seniors’ access to care, the strength of the U.S.-Israel relationship, the national security challenges we face, and more. Following are a few key excerpts from the interview: \n \n On this Week’s Bipartisan, House-Passed Legislation to Strengthen Medicare, Protect Seniors’ Access to Their Doctors & Save Taxpayers Billions: \n \n “Over the last several months, we’ve been trying to find a way to change the way we pay doctors for Medicare patients. And when you look at the agreement that we came to, it’ll strengthen Medicare, make it easier for patients to find doctors, and a fairer way of paying doctors for the services that they render. And I was happy that my Democrat colleagues and I were able to come to an agreement to strengthen Medicare, extend the children’s health plan, extend the authorization for community health centers, and make a bunch of other changes that, frankly, in the long run, will be good for our country.” \n \n On the Strength of the U.S.-Israel Relationship, & the Common Security Threats We Face: “ \n \n There are serious issues and activities going on in the Middle East and I think it’s really, really important for Members of Congress to hear from foreign leaders, other governments, other parts of their government, to get a real handle on the challenges that we face there. … There’s a strong relationship between America and Israel. A very strong relationship between the United States Congress and Israel. And I think over the last several months that relationship has been strengthened, and frankly, part of my goal in going to Israel is to continue to strengthen the relationship that we have between America and Israel. They’re an important ally.” \n \n On the Challenges Facing a Two-State Solution in the Middle East: \n \n Boehner: “How do you have a two-state solution when you don’t have a partner in that solution? When you don’t have a partner for peace? When you’ve got – when the other state is vowing to wipe you off the face of the earth. And so until, until there’s a willing partner willing to sit down and have peace talks, I think it’s irrelevant whether we’re talking about a two-state solution. … I think it’s an aspirational goal. I think when the Prime Minister kind of walked back his comments he realized it’s an aspirational goal, but we’re nowhere close to having anything like it because you’ve got Hamas controlling what goes on on Gaza, and they don’t seem to be interested in peace.” CNN’s Dana Bash: “But, you still believe in a two-state solution, correct? You believe in a Palestinian state?” Boehner: “Yeah, as long as you’ve got a willing partner willing to hold up their end of the deal.” \n \n On Prime Minister Netanyahu’s Address to Congress & the Threat Posed by Iran: \n \n “I had one goal, and that goal was to make sure that the American people heard, and the Congress heard, about the serious threat that Iran poses not only to the Middle East, but for the rest of the world, including the United States. And there’s nobody who can talk more clearly about this. The president doesn’t want to talk about it. Doesn’t want to talk about the threat of radical Islam and the fact that he has no strategy to deal with it. And when you begin to see all these leaks that probably came out of the White House in terms of what the Iranian deal was starting to shape up to be, there’s a lot of concern in Congress on a bipartisan basis, and I’m glad that he was here and frankly, the speech he gave was the clearest speech I’ve heard in 25 years about the real threats that face our country.” \n \n On the Iran Nuclear Talks & the Prospect for Further Sanctions: \n \n “Well, let’s wait and see if there’s an agreement. I’ve got serious doubts – I had serious doubts over the last year whether there could be an agreement and I still have serious doubts. We’ve got a regime that’s never quite kept their word about anything. I just don’t understand why we would sign an agreement with a group of people who, in my opinion, have no intention of keeping their word. …. Listen, the sanctions were working. They would have never come to the table, and frankly we should have kept the sanctions in place so that we could have gotten to a real agreement. And, the sanctions are going to come, and they’re going to come quick.” \n \n On Applying the Skills Learned Growing Up in a Large Family to the Job of Speaker: \n \n “Listen, it’s a big job, somebody has to do this. And you know, all the skills I learned growing up are the skills I’ve needed to do my job. Grew up in a big family – 11 brothers and sisters – you have to learn to get along with each other, get things done together. And you know, today’s political environment’s a little different than it was when I first got here. So that the job that I have is far more challenging than what I think some of my predecessors have had, but I enjoy it every day.” ||||| The U.S. and other world powers and Iran met Monday in a final push to reach an interim nuclear deal — with one foreign minister saying there had been \"some progress and some setbacks\" as a deadline loomed in the negotiations. \n \n Talks aimed at preventing Tehran having the capacity to develop a nuclear bomb in exchange for easing international sanctions have been going on for days in the Swiss city of Lausanne. \n \n \"I can't rule out that there will be further crises in these negotiations,\" German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said told reporters as the talks resumed Monday, adding that there had been \"some progress and some setbacks in the last hours.\" \n \n A senior State Department official denied earlier reports that Iran's refusal to export its atomic fuel was a sticking point that could end prospects of a deal. \n \n Tehran's lead negotiator, Abbas Araqchi, told reporters Sunday that a deal was still \"doable.\" At the same time, he ruled out one of the P5+1's core demands: that Iran send its nuclear stocks out of the country. \n \n RELATED: Iran Nuclear Talks Explained: The Players, The Issues and The Latest \n \n Iran tentatively agreed in November to ship much of its uranium stockpile to Russia, where it would be de-weaponized by converting it into fuel rods for Iran's commercial nuclear power plant. \n \n But Araqchi told reporters Sunday, according to Agence France-Presse: \"The export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program, and we do not intend sending them abroad. There is no question of sending the stocks abroad.\" \n \n \"The talks are in their final phase and are very difficult,\" Araqchi said. \"We are optimistic, the chances of getting a deal are there.

But there are all sorts of smaller pieces to what has been described as a complex puzzle involving a myriad of interests. \n \n The March 31 deadline is to reach a basic deal, with three more months scheduled in to craft a more detailed agreement. The deadline has been moved twice before, but the Obama administration has said it doesn't want to postpone it again. \n \n The Republican-controlled Congress, meanwhile, is prepared to vote to impose stiffer economic sanctions on Iran in mid-April if a deal isn't reached. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also tried to pressure the president not to concede any ground to Iran. \n \n Iran has agreed to halt its nuclear work during the talks.

But it has not been as forthcoming as the United Nations would like about its warhead development. \n \n U.S. and allied negotiators, including France and Germany, have agreed to let Iran perfect centrifuges for medical research at its Fordow facility, but not enrich uranium that could be used for a bomb. \n \n They have also agreed to let Iran keep 6,500 of its 20,000 centrifuges but have put other restraints on fuel and other equipment that they claim would prevent Iran from breaking out. \n \n Any deal would likely involve a phased-in approach to the lifting of sanctions and the limits on certain nuclear work, the U.S. official said.",
    "summary": "– A German foreign minister today cited \"some progress and some setbacks\" in an 11th-hour attempt to reach a nuclear agreement with Iran in Swiss talks—and those \"setbacks\" include a seemingly sudden decision by Iran not to ship the bulk of its uranium to Russia as it had tentatively agreed to do, NBC News reports. \"The export of stocks of enriched uranium is not in our program and we do not intend sending them abroad,\" Abbas Araqchi, Tehran's main negotiator, told reporters yesterday, per AFP. Araqchi maintained, however, that reaching a basic agreement by tomorrow's midnight deadline was still \"doable,\" and a senior State Department official tried to squash rumors that this would effectively end prospects for an interim agreement, per NBC. The uranium was to have been sent to Russia, which would have converted it into fuel rods for Iran's commercial nuclear reactor, rendering it difficult for Iran to extract weapons-grade fuel, the New York Times notes. Critics already hesitant about striking a deal with Iran likely won't view the country's latest announcement as a good one. \"We've got a regime that's never quite kept their word about anything,\" John Boehner told CNN yesterday. \"I just don't understand why we would sign an agreement with a group of people who, in my opinion, have no intention of keeping their word.\" But the US and its allies are expected to point out that the uranium could still be watered down to make using it in weapons more challenging, as well as undergo regular inspections to prevent Iran from posing a serious risk, the Times notes."

    "document": "Revealing full-body scans and genital-touching pat-downs are poised to become a regular fixture of airline travel in the U.S., and people are hopping mad about it.There have been accusations on both sides of fear mongering, insider profiting scandals and abuse Some of the effects of this two month-old change in the way airline passengers are screened are already being felt: CBS News travel editor Peter Greenberg warns that the most immediate effect of these new security procedures will be longer lines and even travel delays, perhaps in no small part because even airline pilots have come out vehemently against them.• There are several reports, some disputed , of dust-ups with Transportation and Security Administration agents not really offering promised alternatives to the scans.• Some reports claim TSA agents are simply booting passengers and pilots from airports for refusing to take part, something the TSA notes is its right to do after a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling.A surprising effect of the scans may eventually be a decline in air travel, according to an online Reuters poll . Reuters' readers were asked whether or not they would change their travel plans to avoid the invasive scans and pat-downs, and a whopping 96 percent (65,708 of 68,513) have thus far said yes.Those numbers could be skewed because one of the plethora of online opponents to the new scanning procedures may have asked readers to go to the site and vote.In contrast, a new CBS News Poll released Monday found 81 percent of Americans think airports should use these new machines -- including a majority of both men and women, Americans of all age groups, and Democrats, Republicans, and independents alike. Fifteen percent said airports should not use them.For her part, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says in a USA Today opinion piece that body scanners used at many airports are safe and the images viewed in private. \n \n Health Blog: Should John Tyner Should Worry about More Than His Junk? ||||| Flying somewhere Nov. 24? You could be walking into the midst of a large-scale protest aimed at getting passengers to turn down full-body scans at airports. \n \n National Opt-Out Day is planned for the day before Thanksgiving, one of the busiest days of the year for airports. A group of activists is calling on passengers to exercise their Transportation Security Administration-given rights and decline full-body scans that allow technicians to see through their clothes. \n \n The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups are up in arms about the scans, saying they violate privacy rights. \n \n But some, including pilots unions, say the slower pat-downs aren't much better. Allegations of improper groping have surfaced recently, causing some to demand new security-screening methods at airports. \n \n \"This country needs security measures in place that not only keep us safe but also do not grossly violate privacy or constitute an unreasonable search, like the current protocol,\" opt-out organizers wrote in a statement on optoutday.com. \n \n A recent CBS poll found that 81 percent of Americans are OK with full-body scanners being used at airports. \n \n The opt-out protest is hoping to motivate Congress to pass harsher laws to protect privacy at airports. \n \n \"It's the day ordinary citizens stand up for their rights, stand up for liberty, and protest the federal government's desire to virtually strip us naked or submit to an 'enhanced pat down' that touches people's breasts and genitals in an aggressive manner,\" organizers said. \n \n They added: \"You should never have to explain to your children, 'Remember that no stranger can touch or see your private area, unless it's a government employee, then it's OK.'\" \n \n Scanners were installed at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport earlier this fall.",

The idea is to pressure Congress into better protecting passenger privacy, reports the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Despite all the recent hubbub, a recent CBS poll found 81% of Americans have no issue with the use of full-body scanners at airports. Still, if you're interested in joining in on the protest, Jeffrey Goldberg at the Atlantic offers this advice to send an especially pointed message: Wear a kilt, sans underwear. \"If nothing else, this will cause TSA employees to throw up their hands in disgust.\""

The FBI and local sheriff's deputies arrested seven men, including Mullet, reputed leader of... (Associated Press) \n \n Among those arrested were the group's leader, Sam Mullet, and three of his sons, said Mike Tobin, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Cleveland. \n \n Several members of the group carried out the attacks in September and October by forcefully cutting the beards and hair of Amish men and women, authorities have said. Cutting the hair is a highly offensive act to the Amish, who believe the Bible instructs women to let their hair grow long and men to grow beards and stop shaving once they marry. \n \n The attacks struck at the core of the Amish identity and tested their principles. They strongly believe that they must be forgiving in order for God to forgive them, which often means handing out their own punishment and not reporting crimes to law enforcement. \n \n Mullet told The Associated Press in October that he didn't order the hair-cutting but didn't stop his sons and others from carrying it out. He said the goal of the hair-cutting was to send a message to Amish in Holmes County that they should be ashamed of themselves for the way they were treating Mullet and his community. \n \n \"They changed the rulings of our church here, and they're trying to force their way down our throat, make us do like they want us to do, and we're not going to do that,\" Mullet said. \n \n At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, U.S. Attorney Steven Dettelbach said religious differences should be a matter of theological debate, not disputes \"resolved by late night visits to people's homes with weapons and violent attacks.\" \n \n He said he does not know how often hate crimes involve intradenominational disputes. \n \n Seven men were in custody and expected to be arraigned Wednesday in Youngstown. They include Mullet; his sons Johnny, Lester and Daniel; Levi Miller; Eli Miller; and Emanuel Schrock. The charges carry a penalty of up 10 years in prison. \n \n The men were sleeping when the FBI and local police showed up at their homes before dawn Wednesday, Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla said. Three men initially refused to come out of their rooms, but all seven were arrested without incident, he said. \n \n The attacks came amid long-simmering tension between Mullet's group, which he established in 1995, and Amish bishops. Arlene Miller, the wife of one victim, said several bishops hadn't condoned Mullet's decision to excommunicate several members who previously left his community, saying there was no spiritual justification for his action. \n \n One of Mullet's daughters-in-law and a former brother-in-law told investigators that Mullet controls everything that happens within the community outside Bergholz and that he allowed others to beat members of the group who disobeyed him, according to an affidavit filed in federal court Wednesday. \n \n Mullet punished some by making them sleep in a chicken coop for days and was sexually intimate with married women in the community so that he could \"cleanse them of the devil,\" the two said in the affidavit. \n \n Both said they left the community because they did not want to live under Mullet's control. \n \n Five men, including Johnny Mullet, Lester Mullet and Levi Miller, were charged in state court last month in Holmes County, the heart of Ohio's Amish country, in an attack on an Amish bishop and his son. They allegedly were held down while men used scissors and a clipper to cut their beards. Similar alleged attacks were under investigation in Amish communities in Carroll, Jefferson and Trumbull counties in eastern and northeastern Ohio. \n \n Authorities have said some Amish refused to press charges, following their practice of avoiding involvement the courts. \n \n One couple refused to press charges even after acknowledging that their two sons and another man came into their house, held them down, and cut the father's beard and the mother's hair. But others have said they decided to press charges to prevent anyone else from getting hurt. \n \n Ohio has an estimated Amish population of just under 61,000 _ second only to Pennsylvania _ with most living in rural counties south and east of Cleveland. \n \n They have a modest lifestyle and are deeply religious. Their traditions of traveling by horse and buggy and forgoing most modern conveniences distance themselves from the outside world and symbolize a yielding to a collective order. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press reporter John Seewer in Toledo contributed to this report. ||||| FBI, deputies arrest 7 Ohio men in attacks on Amish \n \n The FBI and local sheriff's deputies this morning raided an Amish compound in Ohio and arrested seven men, including reputed breakaway sect leader Sam Mullet, on federal hate crimes charges in connection to a series of beard-cutting attacks against other Amish across Ohio. \n \n Agents and deputies swept into the compound in the village of Bergholz, Jefferson County, at 6 a.m. and took the men into custody without incident. \n \n In addition to Mr. Mullet, agents arrested three of his sons: Johnny, Lester and Daniel, along with a nephew, Eli Miller, and a minister, Levi Miller, who is unrelated to the Mullet clan. Also arrested was Sam Mullet's son-in-law, Emanuel Shrock, implicated in the most recent beard-cutting attack against his own father in Jefferson County. \n \n All the men were jailed in Youngstown, Ohio, and arraigned by federal Magistrate Judge George J. Limbert this afternoon, where they learned of the charges against them. They will be held at least until a detention hearing and a preliminary examination next week. \n \n According to an FBI affidavit prepared by an agent from the Canton resident office, Mr. Mullet and other Amish leaders have been feuding for years because of accusations that Mr. Mullet, 66, the bishop in Bergholz and father to 18 children, runs his community like a dictator, doling out discipline for disobedience that includes beatings and forcing men to sleep for days at a time in a chicken coop. \n \n Sam Mullet also has taken women into his home to \"cleanse them of the devil with acts of sexual intimacy,\" according to the affidavit, echoing long-standing claims raised in depositions as part of a protracted civil case that Mr. Mullet filed against Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla over a 2007 incident in which the sheriff forcibly removed Mr. Mullet's daughter's children from the Bergholz compound as part of a custody dispute. \n \n Sam Mullet became bishop in 2003. Two years later, eight families moved away from Bergholz because they didn't like how Mr. Mullet was running the church and the community. As a result, Mr. Mullet ex-communicated those families, the FBI said. Other Amish bishops then questioned whether that action was consistent with Amish beliefs. \n \n In 2005 or 2006, the affidavit said, 300 church leaders met in Ulysses, Pa., to discuss Sam Mullet and his clan. Seven bishops selected to examine his practices determined that the ex-communication would not be recognized because they said Mr. Mullet had acted out of revenge to punish the families for leaving his fold.",
    "summary": "– FBI agents arrested seven men in Ohio and charged them with federal hate crimes in connection with Amish haircutting attacks, the AP reports. Breakaway Amish sect leader Sam Mullet, four family members, and others were taken into custody after agents raided their compound in Bergholz. The men are charged with cutting Amish people’s beards and hair, a major offense in a community that believes the Bible instructs women and men to let their locks grow, USA Today notes. They face up to 10 years in prison. It’s believed the hair-cutting was a response to Mullet’s excommunication by Amish leaders, who were concerned about sexual conduct in his church, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. For his part, the leader said he “didn't order anything like” the hair-cutting, but \"I didn't tell them not to.\""

Maria Cantwell. \n \n Howls erupted from the Twitter-verse when the English version of Wikipedia, the free, collaborative Web encyclopedia and homework crutch of students everywhere, shut down. Google and Facebook were up, although Google slapped a big, black bar across its colorful trademark and directed viewers to a petition. \n \n On Craigslist, those looking to search the classifieds had to first read through a note urging them to contact their representatives to block the bills. \n \n The 24-hour blackout and adverse reaction from Internet users was over the right of business — notably Hollywood and the publishing and recording industries — to make a profit on its work, versus maintaining free and open access to the Internet. \n \n Two bills, the House's Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Senate's Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA), would attempt to stop illegal downloading and sharing of copyright material. Opponents claim the measures would stifle innovation, limit service and impel companies to monitor users. \n \n A third bill, the Senate's Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act (OPEN), authored by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and co-sponsored by Cantwell, aims for middle ground by putting enforcement in the hands of the International Trade Commission, a quasi-government agency that already investigates counterfeit imports and trade-secret violations. \n \n More than 4.5 million people signed their names to the Google petition and 300,000 people emailed or called lawmakers, according to the protest organizers. In Seattle, New York, San Francisco and Las Vegas, protesters held rallies to draw attention to the bills. The Library of Congress said late Wednesday that it had been hit with a denial-of-service attack by \"a group opposed to the online piracy legislation.\" \n \n One by one, prominent backers of the original House and Senate bills dropped off. \n \n First, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., took to Facebook to renounce PIPA, which he had co-sponsored. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, who leads the GOP's Senate campaign efforts, used Facebook as well to urge colleagues to slow the bill down. Sen. Jim DeMint, a South Carolina Republican and tea-party favorite, announced his opposition on Twitter, already boiling over with anti-#SOPA and #PIPA fever. \n \n Trickle then turned to flood — adding Republican Sens. Mark Kirk of Illinois, Roy Blunt of Missouri, Orrin Hatch of Utah, John Boozman of Arkansas and Chuck Grassley of Iowa and GOP Reps. Lee Terry of Nebraska and Ben Quayle of Arizona. In all, at least 10 senators and nearly twice that many House members announced their opposition. \n \n Washington reaction \n \n The backlash also forced several Washington state lawmakers to stake out a position. Reps. Rick Larsen, D-Lake Stevens, Adam Smith, D-Tacoma, and Jay Inslee, D-Bainbridge Island, issued statements Wednesday opposing SOPA. Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Bremerton, tweeted his opposition as well. \n \n Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Seattle, posted his opposition to the bill on his Facebook page Tuesday. \n \n A spokesman for Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said she has \"concerns with these bills as currently drafted.\" \n \n How many websites joined Wednesday's protest was unclear. One estimate said 10,000, but that could have been wishful thinking. \n \n Reddit, the popular social news site, went dark. So did MoveOn.org, WordPress and Mozilla, which operates the Web browser Firefox. Like Wikipedia, they directed viewers to information about the pending legislation. \n \n In a statement posted to his public Facebook profile, co-founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the bills \"get in the way of the Internet's development.\" Google's chief executive, Eric Schmidt encouraged his followers on Twitter to sign Google's petition against the bills, calling on them to \"Defend the Web!\" \n \n \"The Internet has injected itself into the very fabric of society,\" said Zac Cohn, 23, who works with a Seattle-based Internet startup company and who passed out fliers Wednesday at a protest in the city. \"It feels like you're fighting the future if you're trying to regulate the Internet like this.\" \n \n Censorship issue \n \n Cantwell and Wyden, who has blocked PIPA from reaching the Senate floor, have claimed the OPEN Act avoids potential online censorship that could do \"massive damage to the Internet.\" But entertainment companies and others who support PIPA and SOPA have questioned whether the Wyden bill offers adequate enforcement teeth. Technology and Internet companies, on the other hand, said they haven't had time to study it. \n \n Jay Walsh, Wikimedia Foundation spokesman, said the foundation doesn't have a position on Wyden's bill. \"Honestly,\" he said, \"the focus right now is on the threat: SOPA/PIPA.\" \n \n Microsoft, which opposes SOPA and PIPA in their current forms, declined to comment on the OPEN Act. \n \n Ben Huh, CEO and founder of the Cheezburger network of humor sites, said the OPEN Act is \"pretty good\" — except for one provision he strongly dislikes. The measure would accomplish what supporters of SOPA and PIPA seek in terms of preventing copyright infringement, Huh said. What he doesn't like is a provision that grants legal immunity to any company that's in a business relationship with another and wants to cut off the relationship because of suspected copyright infringement. \"If you supply advertising to my site,\" Huh said, \"and if you believe I fall under the OPEN Act as a violator, you can sever the business relationship. I have no recourse.\" \n \n That kind of \"blanket immunity,\" he said, \"is ripe for abuse.\" Still, Huh said he's \"cautiously optimistic\" the immunity provision can be fixed. \n \n Protest a \"gimmick\" \n \n The Motion Picture Association of America called Wednesday's blackout a \"gimmick\" and said \"business interests are resorting to stunts to punish their users or turn them into corporate pawns.\" \n \n But Hollywood, a powerful player in Washington, D.C., suddenly had competition. \n \n Yochai Benkler, a co-director of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, said the blackout showed not only that tech companies had become influential but also that they now recognized they had to work with Congress instead of around it. \n \n He said the day also showed that the tech community and everyone who relied on it could form a potentially daunting alliance. \n \n \"Today was a very strong public demonstration to suggest that what historically was seen as a technical system of rules that only influences the content industry has become something more,\" Benkler said. \"You've got millions of citizens who care enough to act. That's not trivial.\" \n \n Compiled from reports by Kyung Song of The Seattle Times Washington bureau, Times staff reporter Janet I.

More than a dozen former backers of the House's SOPA also announced their opposition. As PIPA and SOPA took a beating, Rep. Darrell Issa and Sen.

    "document": "DAPCHI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Islamist militants freed scores of kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls on Wednesday, driving them back into the town where they had been captured a month ago. \n \n The captors gave no reason for their release, which triggered celebrations and tears, but the government denied that a ransom had been paid. Several of the girls said some of their friends had died in captivity and one was still being held. \n \n The fighters from the Boko Haram group, some shouting “God is greatest”, drove the girls back into the northeast town of Dapchi in a line of trucks in the morning and dropped them off before leaving, witnesses told Reuters. Some residents fled as the convoy rolled in. \n \n “I don’t know why they brought us back but they said because we are children of Muslims,” one of the freed girls, Khadija Grema, told Reuters. \n \n After the release, in the nearby village of Jumbam, some of the girls held each other and wept, huddling on the ground in beige hijabs as residents stood around them. \n \n Aliyu Maina, reunited with his 13-year-old daughter, said the fighters “stopped and blocked the road, they didn’t talk to anybody, they didn’t greet anybody”. \n \n “They said people should make space for people to recognize their children and I got my child.” \n \n Boko Haram has waged a insurgency for nine years in northeast Nigeria and neighboring states in which tens of thousands of people have been killed, more than 2 million displaced and thousands abducted. \n \n A 2015 military campaign drove the group from most territory it controlled, but much of the area remains beyond government rule, and insurgents still stage attacks from strongholds near Lake Chad. \n \n The kidnapping of 110 girls aged 11-19 on Feb. 19 from Dapchi was the biggest mass abduction since Boko Haram took more than 270 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok in 2014 - a case that triggered international outrage. \n \n Dapchi residents said more than 100 girls had returned on Wednesday. As of Wednesday afternoon, the Nigerian government was transporting the girls by bus to Maiduguri, one of the largest cities in the northeast and the hub for the fight against Boko Haram. \n \n “One girl is still with them because she is a Christian,” said Grema, the freed student. “About five are dead but it was not as if they killed them - it was because of the stress and trauma that made them tired and weak.” \n \n “They didn’t harm us,” Grema added. “They were giving us food, very good food. We didn’t have any problem.” \n \n She described how, after the kidnapping, the girls were transported by car and canoe, moving through villages and along waterways to a safehouse. \n \n Some of the newly-released Dapchi schoolgirls board a plane in Maiduguri, Nigeria March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde \n \n Another girl who gave her name as Fatima said two of her friends were among those who died, trampled as they were being transported. \n \n “They kept us in a big, covered house where no one could spot where we were, even by air we could not be seen,” said Fatima. \n \n Muhammad Bursari said his niece Hadiza Muhammed, another of the freed girls, told him the remaining student was still in captivity because she had refused to convert to Islam. \n \n NO RANSOM \n \n Nigeria’s information minister, Lai Mohammed, said in a statement 101 released girls had been registered so far. \n \n “No ransom was paid to them to effect this release,” he told Reuters separately. The only condition they gave us is not to release (the girls) to the military but release them in the town of Dapchi without the military presence.” \n \n Nigeria had secured the release “through back-channel efforts and with the help of some friends of the country,” Mohammed said in the statement. \n \n “For the release to work, the government had a clear understanding that violence and confrontation would not be the way out as it could endanger the lives of the girls, hence a non-violent approach was the preferred option,” it said. \n \n Boko Haram never explained why the girls were taken, but many Nigerians speculated that the goal was ransom. Boko Haram received millions of euros for the release of some of the Chibok girls last year. \n \n The abduction piled pressure on President Muhammadu Buhari, who came to power in 2015 promising to crack down on the insurgency. He is expected to seek re-election next year. \n \n Mohammed Dala said he had found his 12-year-old daughter in a crowd of the girls in the center of town. \n \n “Some motors painted in military color came with our girls,” he told Reuters. “They (the militants) ... said we should not flee. They dropped the girls at the center of town, near Ali’s tea shop. I found my daughter and left.” \n \n Slideshow (11 Images) \n \n Most of the other girls were taken to a hospital guarded by the military, witnesses said. ||||| FILE - This image taken from video on Thursday Feb. 22, 2018 shows the exterior of Government Girls Science and Technical College in Dapchi, Nigeria.

As terrified residents emerged from their homes, the extremists said \"this is a warning to you all,\" resident Ba'ana Musa told The Associated Press. \n \n \"We did it out of pity. And don't ever put your daughters in school again,\" the extremists said.

The girls were released \"through back-channel efforts and with the help of some friends of the country, and it was unconditional.\" \n \n Family members were en route to the town Wednesday morning. \n \n \"When I get there we will do a head count to see if all of them have been released,\" said Bashir Manzo, whose 16-year-old daughter was among those kidnapped during the Feb. 19 attack. \n \n Manzo confirmed that his daughter was among those freed. \n \n \"As I speak to you there is jubilation in Dapchi,\" he said. \n \n The mass abduction and the government response brought back painful memories of the 2014 attack on a boarding school in Chibok. Boko Haram militants abducted 276 girls, and about 100 of them have never returned. Some girls were forced to marry their captors, and many had children fathered by the militants. \n \n Residents in Dapchi fled on Wednesday morning upon hearing that Boko Haram vehicles were headed toward the town. \n \n \"We fled but, from our hiding, we could see them and surprisingly, we saw our girls getting out of the vehicles,\" Umar Hassan told the AP. \n \n \"They assembled the girls and talked to them for some few minutes and left without any confrontation,\" said another resident, Kachallah Musa. \n \n Their release came a day after an Amnesty International report accused the Nigerian military of failing to heed several warnings of the imminent attack last month.

    "document": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ms Erwiana, now in hospital in Indonesia, said she suffered months of abuse from her employer \n \n Police in Hong Kong have arrested a woman suspected of torturing her Indonesian maid, in a case which has sparked protests. \n \n Erwiana Sulistyaningsih, 23, is currently in hospital in Indonesia. She said she suffered months of abuse from the 44-year-old woman in Hong Kong. \n \n Hong Kong employs at least 300,000 domestic workers, mostly from Indonesia and the Philippines. \n \n On Sunday, several thousand rallied in the city to demand justice for her. \n \n Eni Lestari, head of the International Migrants Alliance, said during the protest that they want a speedy investigation into the case. \n \n The arrest in Hong Kong follows a separate complaint by another maid who had been employed by the same woman, reports said. \n \n Hong Kong officials left for Indonesia on Monday to interview Ms Erwiana after launching an investigation into her case last week. \n \n She was reportedly beaten so badly she was in a critical condition and had difficulty walking when she arrived in Indonesia last week. \n \n A spokesman from the hospital on Java Island told Reuters news agency on Sunday that her injuries were extensive, but that her condition had stabilised. \n \n Last year, a couple were jailed for repeated attacks on their Indonesian maid, who said that they beat her repeatedly and burnt her with an iron. \n \n The maid eventually managed to escape and sought refuge at the Indonesian consulate. ||||| Thousands of foreign domestic workers and supporters of the Indonesian maid at the heart of torture allegations rallied yesterday to demand justice for Erwiana Sulistyaningsih and the prosecution of the employer accused of abusing her. \n \n This came as concerned groups identified two other Indonesian workers who claim they were abused by the same woman who is said to have made Erwiana's life a living hell. \n \n One of them, Susi, yesterday gave a statement to police about the year of abuse she claims to have endured from 2010 to 2011. \n \n \"There was a time she asked me to commit suicide because I told her I did not want to work there anymore,\" Susi, 31, alleged to the Post. \"I told her she could hit me but she could not ask me to kill myself. I have a son in Indonesia.\" \n \n The Justice for Erwiana and All Migrant Domestic Workers Committee said 5,000 people marched from Wan Chai's Southorn Playground to police headquarters and on to the government headquarters in Tamar. Police said 2,100 took part at its peak. \n \n Video: Hong Kong maids march for better protection \n \n Speaking after the march, Susi claimed she was paid just HK$5,000 over the year. \n \n She claimed the housewife did not talk to her husband during the year she worked there and suspected the couple's poor relationship might be why she took her anger out on her. Susi said the woman was always at home, while her husband was usually away on business, and added that the couple have a teenaged son and daughter. \n \n Justice committee spokeswoman Sringatin claimed one more Indonesian maid had been abused by the woman during the three months she worked with the family in 2011. \n \n The maid eventually ran away and sought help from her friends and the police. Sringatin said police had still not made any progress in the case. \n \n \"The woman once threatened to kill her with a knife in her hands,\" Sringatin said. \n \n The maid in that case now works in Singapore but is said to be willing to give testimony to Hong Kong police. \n \n Four police officers and two Labour Department officers were due to fly to Indonesia today to meet Erwiana. \n \n The protesters yesterday called on police to step up their investigation. They also urged the government to abolish a rule that requires helpers to live with their employers, which they said made them vulnerable to abuse. ||||| HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong police are investigating allegations that a 23-year-old Indonesian maid was tortured by her employers, the latest case to provoke outrage over abuses suffered by the city's army of foreign domestic workers. \n \n A group representing Indonesian migrant workers in Hong Kong said Thursday that Erwiana Sulistyaningsih came to the city in May and suffered beatings until returning last week to Indonesia, where she's being treated in a hospital. \n \n The family that employed Sulistyaningsih slapped and punched her every day, according to Sringatin, vice-chair of the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union. She said the employers let Sulistyaningsih go back to Indonesia when she could no longer work because of her injuries and gave her just 70 Hong Kong dollars ($9). \n \n Sulistyaningsih needed a friend to help her at the airport because she couldn't walk properly, said Sringatin, who like many Indonesians uses one name. \n \n The case came to light after pictures of Sulistyaningsih's injuries began circulating among Hong Kong's Indonesian community. The photos, which Sringatin said are genuine, show scabs and lacerations on Sulistyaningsih's face, hands and legs, and blackened skin around her feet. \n \n Sulistyaningsih's employers were very strict and demanding, permitting her to sleep only four hours a day and insisting that she do the cleaning in a particular order, Sringatin said. \n \n \"But if Erwiana cleaned the toilet before cleaning the bedroom, the employer would beat her,\" Sringatin said. \"When the employer called Erwiana and she didn't hear, the employer would also assault her.\" \n \n Migrant worker groups in Hong Kong held two protests this week, including one on Thursday, to bring attention to the case and highlight what they called \"modern day slavery.\" \n \n In response to an inquiry about the case, police issued a statement saying they were investigating the allegations after receiving a complaint from a maid placement agency about abuse by an employer, without releasing any names. \n \n Hong Kong's Labor Department said it has been in contact with the Indonesian consulate general in the city, the employment agency and domestic helper groups in relation to the case. \n \n Indonesian Consulate spokesman Sam Aryadi said Sulistyaningsih was undergoing physical and psychological examinations in Indonesia, and that she may return to Hong Kong to help with the investigation. \n \n There are about 312,000 foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong, with Indonesians accounting for about half and Filipinos making up most of the rest. Most are young women. \n \n Last year, a couple was sent to prison for torturing their Indonesian maid with a hot iron, a paper cutter and a bicycle chain. \n \n A report in November by Amnesty International slammed the Hong Kong and Indonesian governments for allowing conditions that left women working as maids vulnerable to widespread abuse and exploitation, including restrictions on freedom of movement, physical and sexual violence, lack of food and long working hours. ||||| HONG KONG: Hong Kong police on Monday arrested a woman who allegedly severely injured her Indonesian domestic helper, a day after thousands staged a march in protest at her treatment. \n \n A police spokeswoman said a 44-year-old woman was arrested at the city's airport on a charge of wounding, but declined to give further details. \n \n Erwiana Sulistyaningsih, 22, was reportedly abused over a period of eight months while employed by the woman. \n \n Media reports said she was unable to walk due to her injuries when she flew home from the southern Chinese city this month. \n \n Police investigators on Monday travelled to Indonesia to interview Sulistyaningsih, who is being treated at a hospital in Sragen on Java island. \n \n Claims that she had been tortured by her employer sparked an outcry by domestic helpers and others and renewed concern about the treatment of maids in Hong Kong. \n \n Several thousand domestic helpers and rights activists staged a protest on Sunday, calling for a speedy investigation of the case and better protection for maids. \n \n Local groups representing domestic helpers have claimed that two other helpers were also abused by the same employer. \n \n One of them complained to police Sunday about her treatment. \n \n Hong Kong employs nearly 300,000 domestic helpers, mainly from Indonesia and the Philippines. \n \n In an earlier case a Hong Kong couple was jailed in September for attacks on their Indonesian domestic helper which included burning her with an iron and beatings with a bicycle chain. \n \n Amnesty International in November condemned the \"slavery-like\" conditions faced by thousands of Indonesian domestic helpers in Hong Kong and accused authorities of \"inexcusable\" inaction. \n \n It said Indonesians were exploited by recruitment and placement agencies who seize their documents and charge them excessive fees, with false promises of high salaries and good working conditions. \n \n The government stipulates a minimum wage and other conditions for foreign domestic helpers, but unscrupulous employers and agencies sometimes ignore this. \n \n \n \n",

    "document": "Two men whose remains were recently excavated from tombs in western China put their pants on one leg at a time, just like the rest of us. But these nomadic herders did so between 3,300 and 3,000 years ago, making their trousers the oldest known examples of this innovative apparel, a new study finds. \n \n With straight-fitting legs and a wide crotch, the ancient wool trousers resemble modern riding pants, says a team led by archaeologists Ulrike Beck and Mayke Wagner of the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin. The discoveries, uncovered in the Yanghai graveyard in China’s Tarim Basin, support previous work suggesting that nomadic herders in Central Asia invented pants to provide bodily protection and freedom of movement for horseback journeys and mounted warfare, the scientists report May 22 in Quaternary International. \n \n “This new paper definitely supports the idea that trousers were invented for horse riding by mobile pastoralists, and that trousers were brought to the Tarim Basin by horse-riding peoples,” remarks linguist and China authority Victor Mair of the University of Pennsylvania. \n \n Previously, Europeans and Asians wore gowns, robes, tunics, togas or — as observed on the 5,300-year-old body of Ötzi the Iceman — a three-piece combination of loincloth and individual leggings. \n \n A dry climate and hot summers helped preserve human corpses, clothing and other organic material in the Tarim Basin. More than 500 tombs have been excavated in a graveyard there since the early 1970s. \n \n Earlier research on mummies from several Tarim Basin sites, led by Mair, identified a 2,600-year-old individual known as Cherchen Man who wore burgundy trousers probably made of wool. Trousers of Scythian nomads from West Asia date to roughly 2,500 years ago. \n \n Mair suspects that horse riding began about 3,400 years ago and trouser-making came shortly thereafter in wetter regions to the north and west of the Tarim Basin. Ancient trousers from those areas are not likely to have been preserved, Mair says. \n \n Horse riding’s origins are uncertain and could date to at least 4,000 years ago, comments archaeologist Margarita Gleba of University College London. If so, she says, “I would not be surprised if trousers appeared at least that far back.” \n \n The two trouser-wearing men entombed at Yanghai were roughly 40 years old and had probably been warriors as well as herders, the investigators say. One man was buried with a decorated leather bridle, a wooden horse bit, a battle-ax and a leather bracer for arm protection. Among objects placed with the other body were a whip, a decorated horse tail, a bow sheath and a bow. \n \n Beck and Wagner’s group obtained radiocarbon ages of fibers from both men’s trousers, and of three other items in one of the tombs. \n \n Each pair of trousers was sewn together from three pieces of brown-colored wool cloth, one piece for each leg and an insert for the crotch. The tailoring involved no cutting: Pant sections were shaped on a loom in the final size. Finished pants included side slits, strings for fastening at the waist and woven designs on the legs. \n \n Beck and Wagner’s team calls the ancient invention of trousers “a ground-breaking achievement in the history of cloth making.” That’s not too shabby for herders who probably thought the Gap was just a place to ride their horses through. ||||| Jeans may have been invented in 1873, but these trousers beat that date by a long shot. A pair of wool pants was recently discovered in a graveyard in western China’s Tarim Basin dating back to around 3,300 years ago. They’re the oldest pants archaeologists have ever found—though they look like they might fit in quite well at Anthropology. \n \n The ancient pants were created for horse-riding, and it shows in the design. They feature straight fitting legs (no bell-bottom here) and a wide crotch with a sewn reinforcement, plus elegant bands of patterned decoration. Rather than the modern method of cutting down large pieces of fabric, the early pants were woven on a loom in precisely-sized segments to form the final garment, like nomad couture. \n \n The find “supports the idea that trousers were invented for horse riding by mobile pastoralists,” University of Pennsylvania China expert Victor Mair tells Science News. So if pants were invented to ride horses in China 5,000 years ago, what excuse do we have for creating crop-tops? ||||| Credit: Archaeological Institute/ M. Wagner (Phys.org) —A team of researchers working in the ancient Yanghai graveyard in China's Tarim Basin has uncovered what appears to be the earliest example of trouser wearing. The research team has published a paper in the journal Quaternary International describing the pants and why they were likely developed to assist with riding horses. \n \n The Tarim Basin in western China is host to the famous Yanghai tombs, a large ancient burial ground that dates back thousands of years—thus far over 500 individual gravesites have been excavated. In this latest find, two adult males (believed to be herders and warriors) both approximately 40 years old at the time of death, were wearing trousers. Carbon dating put the age of the material at approximately 3000 years ago, making the find the oldest known instance of trouser wearing. \n \n In the tomb, along with the bodies, were a horse bit made of wood, a whip, a bow and a battle-axe. These artifacts along with the cut of the pants, suggest the trousers were created and worn to allow for easier horse riding over long periods of time. They also suggest that trouser creation had matured to a level that allowed for custom tailoring. Both specimens were created from three pieces of material (sized to fit a particular individual) one for each leg and a crotch piece—both also had an associated belt made of strings. No cutting was required. Each pant leg also had cross stitching that appeared to serve a purely decorative function. \n \n Many historians believe that trousers were invented as a means of riding horses—riding for a long time can cause skin irritation and discomfort. The trousers worn by horse riders likely migrated to other people, the theory goes, who chose to adopt them for unknown reasons. Its likely modifications were made because riding pants are not particularly comfortable for walking or engaging in everyday life. Prior to trousers, people of both genders tended to wear tunics, robes, togas, etc. It is also generally believed that horse riding by humans began approximately 4000 years ago, which suggests trouser wearing began long before the two men in the Yanghai gravesite donned theirs. \n \n Explore further: High-tech EU project strives to ensure riding is safer for all \n \n More information: The invention of trousers and its likely affiliation with horseback riding and mobility: A case study of late 2nd millennium BC finds from Turfan in eastern Central Asia, Quaternary International, Available online 22 May 2014 dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2014.04.056 \n \n Abstract \n \n Here, we present the first report on the design and manufacturing process of trousers excavated at Yanghai cemetery (42°48′–42°49′N, 89°39′–89°40′E) near the Turfan oasis, western China. In tombs M21 and M157 fragments of woollen trousers were discovered which have been radiocarbon dated to the time interval between the 13th and the 10th century BC. Their age corresponds to the spread of mobile pastoralism in eastern Central Asia and predates the widely known Scythian finds. Using methods of fashion design, the cut of both trousers was studied in detail. The trousers were made of three independently woven pieces of fabric, one nearly rectangular for each side spanning the whole length from waistband to hemline at the ankle and one stepped cross-shaped crotch-piece which bridged the gap between the two side-pieces. The tailoring process did not involve cutting the cloth: instead the parts were shaped on the loom, and they were shaped in the correct size to fit a specific person. The yarns of the three fabrics and threads for final sewing match in color and quality, which implies that the weaver and the tailor was the same person or that both cooperated in a highly coordinated way. The design of the trousers from Yanghai with straight-fitting legs and a wide crotch-piece seems to be a predecessor of modern riding trousers. Together with horse gear and weapons as grave goods in both tombs our results specify former assumptions that the invention of bifurcated lower body garments is related to the new epoch of horseback riding, mounted warfare and greater mobility. Trousers are essential part of the tool kit with which humans improve their physical qualities. \n \n",
    "summary": "– Archaeologists working at an ancient graveyard in western China have unearthed what they say is the oldest pair of pants ever found, reports Science News. In fact, they found two pairs, and the clothing items are not only functional but relatively stylish. The wool pants were found with the remains of two men, each about 40, who lived as many as 3,300 years ago and likely rode horses long distances, based on the riding gear that was placed in the tomb. These particular pants look to be custom-made, suggesting that people had been practicing the art of pants-making for a while, notes Phys.org. \"Rather than the modern method of cutting down large pieces of fabric, the early pants were woven on a loom in precisely-sized segments to form the final garment, like nomad couture,\" explains Time. They even feature decorative cross-stitching. The find bolsters the theory that pants first came into being not too long after horse-riding did—an estimated 4,000 years ago.

In the call, Trickle gave the dispatcher very detailed instructions about where to find the body at Forest Lawn Cemetery in North Carolina.When the dispatcher asked Trickle if he was calling about someone else, Trickle replied, \"No, I'm the one.\"The operator begged Trickle to wait for help ... but her pleas went unanswered.When emergency personnel arrived at the scene, Trickle's body was discovered right where he said it would be.Officials say Trickle died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. ||||| Chuck Trickle knew his brother was hurting, the pain under his left breast never going away. \n \n Dick Trickle went to doctors twice a day, his brother said, to try to get rid of the problem. But the cause of his pain never was determined. \n \n On Thursday, the popular former NASCAR driver died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound in Boger City, N.C., authorities said. Dick Trickle was 71. \n \n “It’s a shock to me,” said Chuck Trickle, who lives in Las Vegas and used to race at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway Bullring. “It’s real hard to think about. He was my brother, my friend and my hero, in that order.” \n \n Chuck Trickle said his brother was healthy, except for the pain under his breast. The brothers spoke a week ago, and Chuck Trickle knew it was serious when he heard Dick Trickle curse for the first time that he could remember. \n \n “He was very down,” Chuck Trickle said. “He more or less said he didn’t know how much longer he could take the pain.” \n \n This isn’t the first tragedy to hit the Trickle family. \n \n Chuck’s son, Chris, was shot in 1997 while driving over the Blue Diamond Road overpass. He died the following year, and the case never was solved. \n \n “To lose (Dick) and to lose my son takes a lot out of me,” Chuck Trickle said. “This is not easy.” \n \n Dick Trickle earned his reputation as a successful short-track driver before joining the Winston Cup Series and earning rookie of the year in 1989 at age 48. \n \n He competed in more than 300 Cup races. Although he never won a Cup race and won just two Busch Series races, Trickle earned cult status. Former ESPN anchor Keith Olbermann regularly would mention where Trickle finished after each NASCAR race. \n \n Former NASCAR driver Geoff Bodine said there was only one way to describe Trickle, a native of Wisconsin Rapids, Wis. \n \n “Fun,” Bodine told The Associated Press. “Just plain fun.” \n \n Trickle never was one to be told how to live his life. He was known for cutting a hole in his racing helmet so he could have a cigarette during cautions. \n \n “He always kept a cigarette lighter in his car,” Bodine said. \n \n Chuck Trickle said his brother was so beloved that “he could’ve run for president and won.” \n \n “He was there for everybody,” Chuck Trickle said. “He left a very large footprint on this earth.” \n \n Dick Trickle’s body was found near his truck at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Boger City, about 40 miles northwest of Charlotte. A Lincoln County sheriff’s lieutenant said foul play was not suspected. \n \n The sheriff’s office said authorities received a call believed to be from Trickle, who said “there would be a dead body and it would be his.” Authorities tried to call the number back, but no one answered. \n \n Trickle lived in Iron Station, N.C., for more than 20 years. Bodine said Trickle was full of stories and popular because of it. \n \n “People everywhere knew his name,” Bodine said. “That’s why they used his likeness in that movie ‘Days of Thunder.’ He was such a character.” \n \n The main character in that popular niche racing movie, played by Tom Cruise, was named Cole Trickle. \n \n Bodine said that a few years ago he had to back out of a celebrity cruise for patients who were on kidney dialysis. He asked Trickle to fill in. \n \n “He made such an impression on people on that ship that everyone wanted to know when Dick was coming back,” Bodine said. “They loved him. They tell me he was the last man to leave most of the bars on the ship, and I believe it.” \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this report.

    "summary": "– Longtime racing driver Dick Trickle not only killed himself yesterday in a North Carolina cemetery at age 71, he matter-of-factly called 911 beforehand to let police know where they would find his body, reports TMZ. The dispatcher initially didn't realize Trickle was referring to himself until he clarified, \"No, I'm the one.\" She asked him to wait for help, to no avail. Trickle's brother in Las Vegas says the retired driver had been in near-constant pain of late, but doctors couldn't figure out the problem, reports the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “He was very down,” says Chuck Trickle. \"He more or less said he didn’t know how much longer he could take the pain,\" which was located under his left breast. Trickle had been a terrific short-track driver early in his career before shifting to NASCAR as a 48-year-old in 1989, reports CNN. Though he didn't win any marquee NASCAR races, Trickle gained renown thanks to his, er, unique name. ESPN's Keith Olbermann went out of his way to mention it during NASCAR coverage. Upon hearing the news yesterday, Olbermann offered up a tweet in tribute: \"No sports figure Dan (Patrick and) I had fun with took it more graciously. In fact, gratefully.\""

    "document": "The U.S. Library of Congress announced this morning via its official Twitter account that it will be acquiring the entire archive of Twitter messages back through March 2006. In addition to a massive printed collection, the Library already has an extensive collection of other digital assets. The Library of Congress is the biggest library in the world. \n \n The Library does extensive work with data format standards, the semantic Web and other platforms for outside analysis. The addition of Twitter into the organization's offerings could foster an enormous amount of academic research. From a new kind of historical record to an unprecedented opportunity for discovering patterns of social interaction, this is big. \n \n When the Library of Congress was founded in the year 1800, publishing was very expensive and relatively few people did it. Today, thanks to blogs, YouTube, Facebook and certainly Twitter it's a new world. Publishing is far faster, easier and more accessible today than at any point in human history. That might seem obvious, but on a day like today it's worth thinking about some more. \n \n For now there are more questions than answers with regards to this Library of Congress Twitter news. Will the archive include friend/follower connection data? Will it be usable for commercial purposes? Will there be a Web interface for searching it, and will that change the face of Twitter search for good? Is there any way that the much larger archive of Facebook data could be submitted to the same body for analysis of the same kind? \n \n These kinds of large data sets are poised to become one of the most important resources the Internet creates. As Kenneth Cukier wrote in The Economist's recent Special Report on Big Data, \"Data are becoming the new raw material of business: an economic input almost on a par with capital and labour.\" \n \n The Library's blogger Matt Raymond put it like this in the blog post about the announcement: \n \n Expect to see an emphasis on the scholarly and research implications of the acquisition. I'm no Ph.D., but it boggles my mind to think what we might be able to learn about ourselves and the world around us from this wealth of data. And I'm certain we'll learn things that none of us now can even possibly conceive. \n \n Nate Anderson at ArsTechnica offers this context: \n \n \n \n There's been a turn toward historicism in academic circles over the last few decades, a turn that emphasizes not just official histories and novels but the diaries of women who never wrote for publication, or the oral histories of soldiers from the Civil War, or the letters written by a sawmill owner. The idea is to better understand the context of a time and place, to understand the way that all kinds of people thought and lived, and to get away from an older scholarship that privileged the productions of (usually) elite males. \n \n Twitter co-founder Biz Stone said today that there are 105 million registered users on the service. How will those users feel about their tweets being archived for posterity? Will non-U.S. users be included (it is a U.S. based company) and object? Lots of questions remain. \n \n There's no word from Twitter itself about this news but we expect details to become public during the Chirp developers conference starting in just a few minutes. Update: Twitter HQ just told us that a blog post about this news is forthcoming. \n \n It's hard to imagine a more significant milepost in social media's early march toward becoming an essential component of our social experience. ||||| (UPDATE: Here’s a December 2017 status report on our work with the Twitter archives.) \n \n (UPDATE: Here’s a January 2013 status report on our work with the Twitter archives.) \n \n (UPDATE: We posted an FAQ on April 28.) \n \n Have you ever sent out a “tweet” on the popular Twitter social media service? Congratulations: Your 140 characters or less will now be housed in the Library of Congress. \n \n That’s right. Every public tweet, ever, since Twitter’s inception in March 2006, will be archived digitally at the Library of Congress. That’s a LOT of tweets, by the way: Twitter processes more than 50 million tweets every day, with the total numbering in the billions. \n \n We thought it fitting to give the initial heads-up to the Twitter community itself via our own feed @librarycongress. (By the way, out of sheer coincidence, the announcement comes on the same day our own number of feed-followers has surpassed 50,000. I love serendipity!) \n \n We will also be putting out a press release later with even more details and quotes. Expect to see an emphasis on the scholarly and research implications of the acquisition. I’m no Ph.D., but it boggles my mind to think what we might be able to learn about ourselves and the world around us from this wealth of data. And I’m certain we’ll learn things that none of us now can even possibly conceive. \n \n Just a few examples of important tweets in the past few years include the first-ever tweet from Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey (http://twitter.com/jack/status/20), President Obama’s tweet about winning the 2008 election (http://twitter.com/barackobama/status/992176676), and a set of two tweets from a photojournalist who was arrested in Egypt and then freed because of a series of events set into motion by his use of Twitter (http://twitter.com/jamesbuck/status/786571964) and (http://twitter.com/jamesbuck/status/787167620). \n \n Twitter plans to make its own announcement today on its blog from “Chirp,” the Official Twitter Developer Conference, in San Francisco. (UPDATE: Here’s their post.) \n \n So if you think the Library of Congress is “just books,” think of this: The Library has been collecting materials from the web since it began harvesting congressional and presidential campaign websites in 2000. Today we hold more than 167 terabytes of web-based information, including legal blogs, websites of candidates for national office, and websites of Members of Congress. \n \n We also operate the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program www.digitalpreservation.gov, which is pursuing a national strategy to collect, preserve and make available significant digital content, especially information that is created in digital form only, for current and future generations. \n \n In other words, if you’re looking for a place where important historical and other information in digital form should be preserved for the long haul, we’re it! \n \n (Thanks to my co-blogger, Jennifer, for the headline. She always does a much better job of that than I do!)",
    "summary": "– Good news: future generations will someday be able to read about what you ate for lunch, your opinions on last night’s Lost, and anything else you’ve decided to Tweet about, in the hallowed halls of the Library of Congress. The Library today announced—via Tweet, naturally—that it would be acquiring Twitter’s entire archive, “ALL public tweets, ever, since March 2006!” The Library has been very active in advancing platforms for understanding online data, ReadWriteWeb explains, so this move could enable a host of new academic research. “I'm no Ph.D., but it boggles my mind to think what we might be able to learn about ourselves and the world around us from this wealth of data,” a Library blogger writes. “I'm certain we'll learn things that none of us now can even possibly conceive.”"

    "document": "* Measure now moves to House for hearings \n \n * Broad tax overhaul effort moving separately \n \n By Kim Dixon and Patrick Temple-West \n \n WASHINGTON, May 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly on Monday to give states the power to enforce their sales tax laws on online purchases, but the legislation faces a tougher fight in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. \n \n The Democratic-controlled Senate voted 69 to 27 to back the measure, which pits brick-and-mortar stores like Wal-Mart Stores Inc and cash-hungry state governments against such Web retailers as eBay Inc and Republicans wary of new tax measures. \n \n \"Call me a conservative, but I believe the right approach to tax fairness is to reduce rates - not force higher rates onto others,\" said Tom Graves, a House Republican from Georgia. \n \n House Speaker John Boehner plans to send the bill to the House Judiciary Committee, a senior Republican aide said. That will mean hearings ahead. The Senate uncharacteristically bypassed this step. \n \n Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Goodlatte, a Republican, has reservations about the legislation, including its complexity and potential impact on small businesses, a spokeswoman said. \n \n Goodlatte has yet to schedule any hearings on it, she said. \n \n Backers of the measure include major traditional retailers Wal-Mart and Best Buy Co Inc, as well as e-tailing giant Amazon.com Inc, which wants to simplify its U.S. state sales tax payments. \n \n Opponents include many other online merchants such as eBay , Overstock.com Inc and anti-tax activist Grover Norquist. Lawmakers from states without sales taxes - like Montana, Oregon and New Hampshire - largely oppose the measure. \n \n States that charge sales tax have largely been unable to require e-tailers to collect it from purchasers unless the e-tailer had a physical presence in the state. Otherwise, consumers are supposed to pay the tax, but very few do. \n \n Some states have made separate arrangements with Amazon on the issue, while others have not. \n \n The bill would let states require out-of-state retailers to collect sales tax on purchases made over the Internet, even if the e-tailer has no physical presence in the purchaser's state. \n \n The bill would allow states to do this but not require them to do so. It would also exempt merchants with online annual out-of-state sales of $1 million or less. \n \n \"We place a 30 percent probability that the bill is signed into law by the end of the year\" primarily due to opposition in the House, said Guggenheim Securities analyst Chris Krueger. \n \n \"Our odds will increase following passage of this bill in the Senate provided it receives a big vote of support,\" he said. \n \n The online sales tax bill debate is moving on a separate track from efforts in Congress on a broader tax overhaul. \n \n The main obstacle on that front remains the dispute between Republicans who refuse to consider new federal revenue from ending tax breaks that would be part of tax reform, and Democrats who insist that such new revenue is vital. ||||| Employees sort holiday orders last Nov. 29 at the GSI Commerce warehouse in Louisville, Ky. GSI Commerce is an eBay subsidiary has handled online retail sales for other companies as well. (Photo: SAM UPSHAW JR. GANNETT) Story Highlights The Senate passes bill requiring online retailers to collect state sales taxes \n \n The measure would still have to pass the House \n \n Big retailers like Walmart and Amazon are pitted against small online retailers \n \n The Senate passed a bill Monday night aimed at making it easier for states to collect sales taxes for online purchases, but its final prospects remain uncertain. \n \n Even so small online retailers are already thinking about the bill's potentially large impact on their operations. \n \n Nancy Mashragi would seriously consider reducing her sales to less than $1 million a year so she'd be exempt from collecting sales tax from customers. \n \n STAKES: Who would win or lose on online sales tax \n \n Mashragi sells refurbished electronics through her eBay store, Concept Electronics. Last year she sold roughly $3 million worth of merchandise. But if the Senate passes the Marketplace Fairness Act tonight, she may cut iPads, which have a high cost but low profit margin, from her inventory so she'd fall within the proposed $1 million small-seller exemption. \n \n FIRST TAKE: Internet taxation shapes Amazon-eBay battle \n \n PROSPECTS: Bill faces hurdles in House \n \n \"That's something off the bat we'd cut out because it's not worth it for us,\" says Mashragi, who is based in Clearwater, Fla., and collects sales taxes for purchases made by Florida residents. \"Why would we go through the hassle of going over that threshold and being responsible for all those taxes on something that has a very low profit margin?\" \n \n CONSUMERS: Advocacy groups largely silent on sales tax \n \n It's a concern she and other small online retailers share. The bill, which passed the Senate 69-27, now heads to the House, where it faces an uncertain future because some Republicans view it as a tax increase. President Obama has said he supports the bill. \n \n The act would overturn decades-long precedent and leave many small online sellers with the task of figuring out how to manage collecting and remitting sales tax to nearly every state. \n \n TIMES HAVE CHANGED \n \n A 1992 Supreme Court case ruled that states could only require businesses to collect sales tax if the business had a physical presence in the state, such as a store or warehouse. Out-of-state retailers — back then the likes of catalogs more than websites — did not have to collect sales tax because it was deemed too difficult for them to abide by so many different tax jurisdictions and rules. \n \n Now that online shopping has grown into a $226 billion-a-year business, and software makes collecting online sales tax across states easier, proponents of the Marketplace Fairness Act say requiring online businesses to comply with the same rules as bricks-and-mortar businesses is long overdue. The act would also require states to simplify their tax codes and provide retailers the software to assist in tax collection at no charge. \n \n \"Not being able to compete on this is a frustration for retailers,\" says David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation. \"(Avoiding sales tax) may not be a primary reason customers shop online, but it's one of them.\" \n \n The issue pits retail behemoths such as Walmart and Amazon against small online sellers such as those on eBay in a fight for price and industry dominance. Those in support of the bill, which include Walmart, Amazon and Target, argue they're at a 5% to 10% price disadvantage by having to charge sales tax. States argue they're missing out on much-needed revenue. Last year, states could have collected more than $11 billion in online sales tax revenue, according to a study by the University of Tennessee. \n \n \"The attempt to do this was almost inevitable given the billions of dollars of transactions that are now being conducted electronically,\" says Dan Effron, a partner in the tax services group of Marcum LLP, an accounting and consulting firm. But, he says, \"I in no doubt agree that the burden of complying with this law on small to medium-size businesses would be a real hindrance.\" \n \n Online retailers say the administrative burden of collecting sales tax would curb business growth and make it harder to compete. Perhaps the most contentious provision is a $1 million small-seller exemption — anyone with less than $1 million a year in out-of-state sales wouldn't have to collect sales tax. Small sellers and their advocates say that number is too small. \n \n EBay is at the helm arguing for a small seller exemption of $10 million in sales, or businesses with fewer than 50 employees. \n \n \"It's going to make it harder for small businesses to compete, because it will raise the price of their product,\" says Brian Bieron, eBay's head of global public policy. \"We think the current situation is actually quite fair when you're talking about small business online and small business in stores. The small brick-and-mortar business and small online business both collect sales taxes where they operate.\" \n \n At question is whose responsibility it is to collect sales tax, and when that responsibility should kick in. Technically, consumers are already supposed to pay taxes on out-of-state or online purchases as use taxes — many states require them to disclose these purchases on their tax return forms. But most people don't. \n \n \"The issue is really, does the seller have an obligation to collect the tax that the consumer owes?\" says Harley Duncan, managing director and state and local tax leader of KPMG's Washington National Tax practice. \"I think it's clear that if the tax is going to be effectively collected it's going to have to be collected by the seller.\" \n \n A BIG JOB FOR LITTLE GUYS \n \n The bigger issue for many small business e-tailers isn't necessarily losing a price advantage, but dealing with the extensive administrative and logistical costs of collecting and remitting sales taxes for every state. \n \n \"You need manpower to overlook this,\" says Mashragi of Concept Electronics, which employs eight people plus herself and her husband. Since the business is based in Florida, Mashragi already collects sales tax from Florida residents. She explains that despite software that automatically charges Florida customers sales tax, an employee still has to go through every transaction and every refund made to determine how much sales tax the company collected. She anticipates the same process for every state should the Marketplace Fairness Act pass. \n \n \"Unfortunately, we're probably going to have to downsize,\" she says, in order to hire someone solely to focus on tax collection. \"It's a challenge for us to employ this many people and keep our heads above water.\" \n \n Ann Whitley Wood, whose eBay store Willow-Wear does just under $1 million in sales a year, is also worried about continuing to grow her business and hire employees if she eventually has to collect sales tax. \n \n \"Even if it was simplified to one (tax) rate per state, that is still 45 tax-collecting states, and that is an incredible burden of time,\" she says. \n \n Alaska, Delaware, New Hampshire, Oregon and Montana do not have sales taxes. \n \n Small online sellers are also worried about the potential to be audited by nearly every state. Others wonder why they should be expected to collect sales tax for jurisdictions where they won't benefit from the services the taxes go toward. \n \n \"They're not imposing the cost that the tax is offsetting,\" says Brad Wilson of online-only retailers. Wilson is the founder of BradsDeals.com, a website that helps shoppers find the best online deals. \"If I buy shoes on shoes.com, Chicago doesn't even know,\" he says as an example. \"(Online retailers) don't need more cops or streets paved or whatever else goes into supporting (local) retail.\" \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/106ziXc",

(Photo: Greg Barnette / USA TODAY Network California) \n \n Update 3 p.m. Friday: Through their attorney, the family of Elizabeth Thomas confirmed she is \"in a safe location with family and friends\" after arriving back in Tennessee on Friday afternoon. \n \n \"She is being evaluated and treated by mental health experts specializing in trauma,\" the statement reads. \"There is no doubt that she suffered severe emotional trauma and that her process of recovery is only just beginning.\" \n \n Original story: Even in a remote California forest cabin with no cell phone service, nearly 2,500 miles from Columbia, Tenn., former Middle Tennessee teacher Tad Cummins couldn’t hide. \n \n It took one phone call to Tennessee law enforcement late Wednesday night to end a six-week manhunt for the man police accused of kidnapping 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas. \n \n On Friday, Siskiyou County Sheriff Jon Lopey said Elizabeth is under protective care. She arrived in Tennessee Friday, an attorney for her family said. \n \n Cummins, meanwhile was taken into federal custody in Siskiyou County and is being transported to Sacramento. \n \n On Thursday morning in frigid weather, the Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office arrested Cummins at the Cecilville cabin in northern California and rescued Elizabeth, according to the sheriff's office and the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. \n \n \"We mobilized a nation in the last six weeks,\" TBI Director Mark Gwyn said Thursday during a news conference in Nashville. \"When you do that, something good is going to happen because you can’t hide from millions of people. It took only one tip.\" \n \n It was an 11 p.m. call Wednesday from a California man. \n \n The caller said he spotted a Nissan Rogue at a cabin, and thought it matched the description of the vehicle used by Cummins. The license plate had been removed from the vehicle, said TBI spokesman Josh DeVine. \n \n Related: \n \n ► How two Californians helped capture Tennessee's most wanted man \n \n ► Sister of Elizabeth Thomas \"ecstatic\" police found her safe \n \n ► Unconfirmed sighting of Elizabeth Thomas at Nashville hotel \n \n ► Timeline shows troubling events before Elizabeth Thomas' disappearanc \n \n Lopey said his office's special response team went to the cabin, which was two hours away from their headquarters. By 4 a.m., the team surrounded the cabin and waited. When Cummins walked out about 9:30 a.m., he was arrested without a scuffle, Lopey said. Elizabeth came out of the cabin as the arrest took place, Lopey said. \n \n Deputies found two loaded handguns — a 9 mm pistol and a Ruger .380 — and multiple license plates in the cabin nestled in massive Siskiyou County, which is filled with national forest and state lands and borders the California-Oregon state line. \n \n Lopey said FBI officials from Redding, Calif., had Elizabeth in their custody on Thursday. \n \n Cummins is being held without bond on a federal charge of knowingly transporting a minor in interstate commerce with the intent to engage in sexual activity. \n \n Booking photo for Tad Cummins after his arrest in California. (Photo: Siskiyou County Sheriff's Office) \n \n Cummins was Elizabeth's 50-year-old high-school teacher at Culleoka Unit School in Maury County, Tenn. \n \n His capture ended a nationwide manhunt that began March 13. Since then, officers worked on more than 1,500 leads and put in countless hours. \n \n TBI agents flew to Cecilville Thursday to investigate and gather evidence, authorities said. \n \n Although Elizabeth was found healthy and unharmed, officers said they do not know her mental condition. She is expected to fly back to Tennessee Friday on a TBI aircraft. \n \n Maury County District Attorney Brent Cooper said, \"There is more work to do to build a case for prosecution.\" \n \n \"Our main concern now is how is she emotionally,\" Cooper said. \"Whether she was brainwashed or went willingly? We don't know what the situation is yet.\" \n \n Gwyn thanked communities across the nation for helping locate the two. \n \n “We hope we can keep him behind bars for many years,” Gwyn said. “And to the public, we cannot say how thankful we are for all the tips, concern and support. It made a difference in the six-week search.” \n \n Family and a Tennessee community reacts to Cummins' capture \n \n After Elizabeth's rescue, her family waited to talk with her. \n \n \"We were ecstatic,\" said Kat Bozeman, Thomas' oldest sister. \"We're so happy that California police worked quickly and were able to find them and get her safe. I believe the FBI are going to make sure she's healthy before she comes home. We'll make sure she'll get what therapy she needs and that she's safe, that she knows she's safe. \n \n \"Like we've always said from the beginning, law enforcement will deal with (Cummins) and our only concern was her to be returned safely,\" Bozeman said. \n \n Maury County residents also rejoiced after learning Elizabeth had been found. \n \n Elizabeth Thomas (Photo: TBI) \n \n “When something like this happens, a community gets together and feels like this is one of our children,” said Republican Rep. Sheila Butt, who represents Columbia. “This just feels like our prayers have been answered, and the lost sheep is home.” \n \n She said she is confident local officials will find a way to learn from this entire ordeal. \n \n “I have known Tad Cummins over the years, and I think I could honestly tell you that I’m not surprised that she’s safe.

Add Missing Tennessee Student as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Missing Tennessee Student news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest \n \n The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation received the tip around 11 p.m. Wednesday and the caller pointed authorities to a cabin in Cecilville, a rural area near the Oregon border with little to no cell service, TBI Public Information Officer Joshua Devine said. \n \n The caller indicated that 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas and her former teacher, 50-year-old Tad Cummins, may have been living in the cabin for a week-and-a-half, Devine said. \n \n The Siskiyou County Sheriff's Office also received a similar tip from the same individual around the same time, the sheriff's office said. \n \n KDRV \n \n Deputies in Siskiyou County located a 2015 silver Nissan Rougue at the cabin that matched the description of the car Cummins was driving, according to the sheriff's office. Investigators were then able to use the car's VIN number to confirm that it belonged to Cummins and kept the car under surveillance for several hours, Devine said. \n \n Law enforcement then established a perimeter around the cabin and decided to wait until the morning to arrest Cummins as he exited the cabin, according to the sheriff's office. A citizen who had befriended the pair assisted police on the scene. \n \n As daylight broke, Cummins was taken into custody, Devine said. Thomas family attorney Jason Whatley said a special police unit \"swooped in\" on the cabin with \"force.\" \n \n The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation \n \n Elizabeth exited the cabin behind Cummins and was taken into FBI custody in Redding, California, authorities said. \n \n Two loaded handguns were recovered in the cabin, as well as personal items belonging to the pair, according to the sheriff's office. \n \n Cummins was transported to the Siskiyou County Jail in Yreka, according to the sheriff's office. He will be arraigned Friday morning. \n \n It could take weeks to extradite Cummins, the FBI said. \n \n Cummins faces charges in Siskiyou County for kidnapping and possession of stolen property, according to the sheriff's office. The charges are pending review by Siskiyou County District Attorney Kirk Andrus. \n \n In Lawrence County, Tennessee, Cummins faces charges of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor, said Attorney General Brent Cooper. \n \n The U.S. State Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee also filed a federal charge of transportation of a minor across state lines with intent of having criminal sexual intercourse against Cummins, said U.S. attorney Jack Smith. The charge carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison. \n \n Tennessee Bureau of Investigation \n \n Whatley speculated that Cummins had planned an escape to the Northwest, referencing the sighting of the two at a Walmart in Oklahoma City off Interstate 44, which leads to California. \n \n There are \"particular qualities in the Northwest that make it easy to disappear,\" Whatley said. \n \n Elizabeth was described by authorities to be \"healthy\" and \"unharmed,\" but they added that the main concern is the state of her emotional and mental well being. She will be flown back to Tennessee Friday morning on a TBI aircraft, Devine said. \n \n The teen had been missing since she was allegedly kidnapped on March 13 by Cummins, who had been added to Tennessee's Top 10 Most Wanted list. A day after they disappeared, Cummins was fired from his teaching job at Culleoka Unit School, where Elizabeth had been a student in his forensics class. \n \n Authorities credited citizens and the media for their involvement in helping to locate the teen. Investigators received more than 1,500 tips regarding the whereabouts of the pair, according to the FBI. \n \n \"It only takes one tip,\" Gwyn said. \"This is yet another example of the value of the public helping us to rescue a kidnapping victim.\" \n \n ABC News' Morgan Winsor and Emily Shapiro contributed to this report.",
    "summary": "– The manhunt for fugitive Tennessee teacher Tad Cummins is over thanks to somebody who spotted his vehicle in a remote area on the other side of the country, authorities say. The 50-year-old was captured and 15-year-old student Elizabeth Thomas was taken into custody unharmed after the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the sheriff's office in Northern California's Siskiyou County received a tip late Wednesday that a vehicle with no license plate that matched the description of Cummins' 2015 Nissan Rogue was at a cabin in a rural area of Cecilville, near the Oregon border, ABC News reports. The caller said an adult male and a young female had been staying in the cabin for about a week. Police set up a perimeter around the cabin after the call and arrested Cummins after he emerged around 9:30am Thursday, the Tennessean reports. Siskiyou Sheriff Jon Lopey says two loaded handguns were found inside. Cummins is being held without bond on a federal charge of knowingly transporting a minor with the intent to engage in sexual activity and will be arraigned on Friday. Police say Thomas, who came out of the cabin as Cummins was being arrested, has been transferred to FBI custody and is being treated as a crime victim, the Siskiyou Daily News reports. TBI chief Mark Gwyn says Cummins was caught because they \"mobilized a nation\" to be on the lookout, and \"you can't hide from millions of people.\""

    "document": "With a West Wing office but no specific title – and no precedent for adult children whose father is president – the rules Trump is subject to are under dispute \n \n After months of attending meetings of world leaders and visiting factories with her father, the role of first daughter Ivanka Trump is officially expanding – creating new ethical issues for an administration that has been heavily criticized over its potential conflicts of interest. \n \n \n \n Ivanka Trump has West Wing office and will get access to classified information Read more \n \n She will not have a specific title, but Trump will have an office in the West Wing, a government-issued phone and computer and security clearance to access classified information, and she will advise her father. \n \n “While there is no modern precedent for an adult child of the president, I will voluntarily follow all of the ethics rules placed on government employees,” she told Politico in a statement. \n \n \n \n But following the ethics guidelines should not be voluntary, said Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who served as chief ethics lawyer for George W Bush between 2005 and 2007. \n \n “Given what she’s going to do, I don’t think she has any choice,” he said. “She has a West Wing office, she has equipment, she has a White House email address, she’s going to be doing policy work,” said Painter. \n \n “For purposes of the conflict of interest statute, I believe she is a government employee,” he added. \n \n \n \n Ivanka Trump’s lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, argues that since she will earn no salary and not be sworn in, she does not count as a government employee. There is no precedent for adult children whose father is president working in the White House, although two presidents – Andrew Jackson and James Buchanan – had their nieces serve in the role of first lady since Jackson was a widower and Buchanan a bachelor. \n \n Trump has handed control over the day-to-day running of her eponymous clothing business to an executive and its assets are maintained by a trust managed by two of her husband’s siblings. \n \n As part of the trust rules, outlined in the New York Times, Trump can veto any potential business deals for her clothing company that might create a conflict with her political work. \n \n \n \n That means, points out Painter, that Trump has to know about any new deal that might put her at risk of breaking the statute, meaning she can be held responsible. \n \n “She’s got accountability on that stuff. She can’t just blame the trustee,” he said. \n \n Trump’s marriage to her father’s senior adviser, the real estate developer Jared Kushner, poses additional potential problems, because both could benefit financially from each other’s businesses. \n \n \n \n Painter warned that the pair should avoid official political discussions involved with trade agreements regarding textiles, real estate and even bank deregulation, since that can affect real estate. \n \n Ivanka Trump sees show on welcoming foreigners as new travel ban halted Read more \n \n That means if the premier of China visits the White House – most of Ivanka Trump’s clothing line is made in China and Hong Kong – it is fine for her to attend the meeting, but she should not mention trade and if the discussion begins to focus on trade, she should excuse herself, says Painter. \n \n The ethics expert noted approvingly that Ivanka Trump engaged Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, the same legal services used by the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, former head of ExxonMobil, to handle issues of conflict of interest. Kushner also used the DC-based lawyers to manage his potential conflicts of interest with his family business after taking the role of adviser in the Trump administration. \n \n “It’s a criminal statute, so people better not mess up under it. But I think she’ll do the right thing,” said Painter. ||||| Ivanka Trump's Move To The White House Raises Questions About Ethics \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images \n \n When Donald Trump was elected president, his daughter Ivanka Trump said she would move to Washington, D.C., but not into a White House office. \n \n Since then, she has often been photographed in key White House meetings with foreign leaders and Cabinet members. Now she will have her own office in the West Wing, along with a security clearance and government-issued communications devices. \n \n In her unpaid role, Ivanka will \"continue to be the eyes and ears of her father and provide candid advice as she has for her entire adult life,\" her attorney, Jamie Gorelick, said in an NPR interview. \"She is intending to spend some time on initiatives that she cares about, particularly with regard to women in the workplace.\" \n \n Politics Ethics Experts Raise Alarm Over Ivanka Trump's White House Role Ethics Experts Raise Alarm Over Ivanka Trump's White House Role Listen · 2:29 2:29 \n \n Ivanka's elevated position has historians and ethics experts questioning the appropriateness of having one of the president's adult children serving directly in the administration, especially while continuing to own a business. \n \n Julian Zelizer, a political historian at Princeton University, says Ivanka's White House role raises concerns such as: \"Do the rules apply on nepotism, on conflict of interest, on other kinds of regulations that employees face?\" \n \n Zelizer says previous presidents have relied upon children for input. For example, President Teddy Roosevelt's daughter Alice frequently offered political advice, and George W. Bush often played an advisory role when his father, George H.W. Bush, was president. \n \n But this situation is different because it appears Ivanka will be have an expansive portfolio, not just offer insights. She will not be sworn in, nor need Senate approval. \n \n Her husband, Jared Kushner, also is serving in the administration, but he has official status as a senior adviser who took an oath of office. Earlier this year, some critics questioned whether his role violated the anti-nepotism law passed in 1967 to prevent a president from placing a relative in a Cabinet or federal agency job. \n \n But that law was challenged when President Bill Clinton named his wife, Hillary Clinton, to lead a task force on health care. A federal judge ruled in that case the anti-nepotism law doesn't apply to White House staff jobs. \n \n When Kushner came into the White House job, he turned over his role in his family's real estate empire to family members, who continue to own the business. \n \n Ivanka plans to continue to own her eponymous fashion and jewelry business, even though she has stepped back from daily management. Her father has followed that pattern, too, continuing to own The Trump Organization while putting his two eldest sons in charge of management. \n \n \n \n Gorelick said Ivanka spoke with the White House counsel about the ethical implication of taking this role and \"they are comfortable with what she's doing.\" \n \n She added that Ivanka will \"abide by all the ethical rules that she would abide by if she were an employee.\" \n \n But just having a high-visibility role could stir up questions about whether her White House presence could be seen as promoting her products as people try to curry favor with her. \n \n \"She is not simply part of the family; she is a businesswoman,\" Zelizer notes. \n \n Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St Louis and a specialist in government ethics, says the Trump administration's arguments that conflict-of-interest rules don't bind the president or his daughter are disheartening. \n \n \"My biggest concern is that this is yet another erosion of government ethics standards in this White House,\" Clark said.",
    "summary": "– Ivanka Trump has attended meetings with foreign leaders and Cabinet members; she has security clearance that allows her access to classified information, a government-issued phone and computer, a White House email address, and even her own White House office. She still doesn't have an official White House job, but NPR and the Guardian talked to historians and ethics experts who are concerned with the ethical implications of Trump having such a high-profile role, even if an unpaid one, in her father's administration—particularly since she still owns a business. Since her role is not official, she requires no swearing-in and no Senate approval. And, though past presidents have looked to their children for insight before, Trump's role looks to be more extensive than simply offering advice. Trump's attorney explains her role to NPR thusly: She will \"continue to be the eyes and ears of her father and provide candid advice as she has for her entire adult life,\" plus \"spend some time on initiatives that she cares about, particularly with regard to women in the workplace.\" She'll do all that while continuing to own her fashion and jewelry line, though she won't be as involved in managing the company; one political historian points out that could raise questions about whether her presence in the administration is looked at as promotion for her company. Trump's attorney says White House counsel is \"comfortable\" with the ethics of her role in the administration, and that Trump will abide by the same ethical rules paid employees abide by. The former chief ethics lawyer for George W. Bush concludes, \"For purposes of the conflict of interest statute, I believe she is a government employee.\""

    "document": "A humble house cat's bid for the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Jim Webb (D-Va.) caught fire this week, drawing messages of praise from Russia and Saudi Arabia, with one group offering to go door to door canvassing for the caramel-colored kitty. \n \n But the claws are also out. Opponents of the comic \"Hank for Senate\" campaign have released a feline-bashing, drag-'em-into-the-litterbox attack ad. \n \n \"Hank for Senate? No Way,\" posted on YouTube, doesn't pussyfoot around. Taking a cue from many of the hottest political attacks, Hank's dogged detractors point out that this would-be four-legged lawmaker has never released his birth certificate or his tax returns. They also question whether he has ever been to a vet, and they aren't above a little name-calling. \n \n \"Should a Maine coon be running for Senate in Virgina?\" the ad asks as the word \"carpetbagger\" appears onscreen. \n \n WATCH \"Hank for Senate? No Way.\" (Story continues below.) \n \n Hank is taking the fiery fight in stride, campaign manager Matthew O'Leary told The Huffington Post. \n \n \"He's still taking his daily naps and getting excited about cheese,\" O'Leary said. \"He was a bit grumpy for his last televised interview, but that appeared to be because it was too close to dinnertime, so we're scheduling his appearances for midafternoon and he's doing well.\" \n \n The catnip-roots campaign won't respond to negative ads, but according to his spokesman, Hank thinks the ad is baseless and part of those \"same Washington insider tricks.\" \n \n Thus far, Hank's campaign has centered on the need for jobs. He also advocates for spay and neuter programs and rescue groups, such as the one that saved him in Virginia. \n \n \"Hank has expressed concern that politicians ask for Americans' hard-earned money and then spend it on ads that continue this vicious, hateful cycle,\" O'Leary said. \n \n In their ad, the candidate's political opponents also touch on Virginia's recent reproductive rights controversy. The spot asks, \"Would Hank force females to undergo an ultrasound before being spayed?\" \n \n On another front, O'Leary wanted to clear away the criticism of Hank's weight. He is not a \"fat cat,\" as the video says. In fact, O'Leary said, Hank's enthusiasm for leaping high and staying fit would do Michelle Obama's \"Let's Move\" campaign proud. The candidate works out daily with a bouncy ball, and at his last veterinary visit, his 12 pounds were pronounced perfect for his age and breed. \n \n \"He has Republican roots as cats tend to be more conservative,\" O'Leary said. \"He also only tears up liberal books when trying to wake me for breakfast.\" \n \n The anti-Hank ad was posted by an account called \"The Big Honkin',\" which identifies itself as a group of writers, directors, visual-effects creators, editors, producers, actors, and filmmakers from Virginia, but the super PAC Canines for a Feline Free Tomorrow claimed credit for the spot. \n \n ||||| Friends, we live in troubled times - there's no doubting that. We hear all about friends and neighbors - people just like you and me - who are struggling to make ends meet. Unemployment has touched us all in some way, and we all suffer for it. I hear a lot of new and crazy ideas on how to fix things - spend more money, give more handouts, start new programs, and so on. What people don't realize is that we don't need some new crazy way of doing something to fix our problems. Afterall, the problems we face now have been faced by Americans since this great land was founded. Right now we need to fall back on time-tested solutions, not social theory. As I've traveled throughout the Commonwealth I've seen real people with real problems, not guinea pigs for a politician's experiments. To make our homes and our future a better and brighter place, we don't need to start at the top - we need to start right here with ourselves. If you improve the living condition of a single home, it has a ripple effect throughout the street. Improve the street, it ripples to the neighborhood. Improve the neighborhood, it ripples to the county. Improve the county, it ripples through the state. Improve the state, it ripples to the entire nation. In each of us we have the power to improve our own lives, to improve the lives of our neighbors, our state, and our country. I was born in Virginia, and grew up right here in Fairfax County. I'm proud to have lived my life in the homeland of George Washington, and proud to call this great state my own. Virginia has shown the kind of can-do attitude that has kept this country great. Even in times of economic downturn, our state continues to grow and thrive where others have shrunk and whithered. But I know we can't rest on our laurels and hope everything will turn out okay. Today we're beginning to struggle - if we do nothing, what will happen? I for one don't want to find out, which is why I've decided to run for the United States Senate. I know that with our values, our strength, our undying love of this great state and this great nation, we can make our lives better - not just for us, but for generations to come.

Stiviano, Woman Accused of Leaking Racist Rant \n \n \"God teaches us to forgive, and the way I look at it, after a sustained period of proof to the African American community that those words don't reflect his heart, I think there's room for forgiveness. I wouldn't be a Christian if I said there wasn't,\" Jenkins said. \n \n \"We are negotiating with him about giving more moneys to African American students at UCLA, and so we are in preliminary discussions,\" Jenkins said. He also noted, however, they had not spoken since the scandal broke. \n \n The news conference was held to discuss the organization's decision to cancel plans to honor to Sterling with a lifetime achievement in the wake of the tape, which allegedly contained an argument between Sterling, 80, and his girlfriend, Vanessa Stiviano, 31, in which the male voice on the recording makes many racist comments. \n \n The male voice is heard telling Stiviano not to post pictures of herself with black people to Instagram or bring black people to Los Angeles Clippers games, including Magic Johnson. Stiviano's lawyers claim the recording is authentic and contains the voice of Sterling. \n \n LA Clippers President Andy Roeser said in a statement Saturday the team did not know if the tape is legitimate or has been altered. Roeser said that Donald Sterling told him that Stiviano had previously said she would \"get even\" for the lawsuit brought by Rochelle Sterling. \n \n The team released a statement saying, “Mr. Sterling is emphatic that what is reflected on that recording is not consistent with, nor does it reflect his views, beliefs or feelings. It is the antithesis of who he is, what he believes and how he has lived his life.\" \n \n The recording sent shock waves through the NBA. The Clippers players protested Sterling by wearing their jerseys inside out at a playoff game Sunday, and the league is investigating what actions it may take against Sterling if the voice on the tape is verified to be his. \n \n The Los Angeles chapter of the NAACP posted on its website over the weekend that it would not give Sterling the Lifetime Achievement award after all. \n \n Jenkins said that the NAACP had been working closely with Sterling on contributions to the black community in southern California, including creating an endowment at a predominantly black college in the LA area and a scholarship program for black students at UCLA. \n \n \"The mission of the NAACP is to eradicate discrimination and racial hatred in all its forms, and each year our executive board votes on who we decide that we are going to honor,\" Jenkins said. \"Mr. Sterling has given out a tremendous amount of scholarships, he has invited numerous African American kids to summer camps, and his donations are bigger than other sports franchises.\" \n \n \"That is something that shows that there is a consciousness of the plight of African Americans in this country,\" Jenkins said. \n \n Jenkins noted that Sterling had previously been awarded a humanitarian honor from the group and that it would not revoke that. \n \n In 2009, ESPN Magazine went with Sterling to the awards ceremony for that honor, which the magazine described as Lifetime Achievement Award, though Jenkins denied that term today. The magazine profiled Sterling amid legal allegations by the Justice Department that he discriminated against minorities in housing units he rented. Sterling ultimately settled with the government. \n \n Jenkins was quoted in the 2009 article saying that Sterling had donated $10,000 to $15,000 in that year alone to the NAACP. \n \n Sterling is quoted in the story saying about the reporter, \"Do you know why they're here? They want to know why the NAACP would give an award to someone with my track record.\" \n \n Jenkins said at the press conference today that the NAACP has worked with Sterling for 15 to 20 years and that Jenkins' predecessor nominated Sterling for the 2009 award. ||||| More alleged comments from Donald Sterling surface Sunday.

(KSTU) — The missing Utah Transit Authority worker has been found dead in Wyoming, according to the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office. \n \n Officials said the body of 63-year-old Kay Porter Ricks was found about 16 miles south of Kemmerer in a rural area Thursday night. \n \n His truck is still missing; the Sublette County Sheriff’s Office said it is launching a search and rescue boat equipped with sonar technology on both Fremont and Half Moon lakes, weather permitting, to search for it. \n \n Authorities said this is not a suicide; his body had been there for days. \n \n The Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office said deputies were following up on leads about a UTA truck sighting in the area when they found Ricks. \n \n Ricks, a UTA maintenance worker, was last seen May 12 near the Ballpark UTA station during his work shift. \n \n Someone found his cellphone on a TRAX platform and turned it in to police. \n \n Ricks’ work truck also went missing. It is unknown if it has been located. \n \n Authorities are investigating if Ricks’ disappearance may be connected to the Centerville kidnapping case on May 11. \n \n Dereck James Harrison, 22, and his father, Flint Wayne Harrison, 51, are accused of tying up a mother and her four daughters in a basement home. \n \n After the mom and her teen daughters escaped, the men fled the state to Sublette County, Wyoming. \n \n Sublette County Sheriff’s Spokeswoman Katherine Peterson said Ricks was not found in their jurisdiction. \n \n UTA detectives first contacted Centerville authorities during their investigation to see if they were aware of a connection to the kidnapping and assault case. \n \n UTA officials would not comment on the case but stated they would provide an update on Wednesday. \n \n Update from Sublette County Sheriff’s Office: \n \n Late in the evening of May 17, a body was located in Lincoln County, WY, and was positively identified as missing Utah Transit Authority worker Kay Porter Ricks, 63, who had been missing from the Salt Lake City area since Thursday, May 12. \n \n The Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigations is handling the investigation into the death of Mr. Ricks. The Sublette County Sheriff’s Office is continuing investigation efforts with Wyoming and Utah authorities, though the focus of the investigation has shifted primarily to Lincoln County and DCI. \n \n The UTA maintenance truck that had been reported missing with Mr. Ricks is still missing, and agencies throughout the west are still on the lookout. The vehicle is described as a white Ford F-150, with a truck bed mounted equipment rack, UTA markings, and bearing Utah license plate #206886. \n \n The Sublette County Sheriff’s Office will launch a search and rescue boat equipped with sonar technology on both Fremont and Half Moon lakes today, weather permitting. ||||| Ricks' UTA vehicle was last seen Thursday evening being driven by a man near the Ballpark Trax station, at 1300 S. 200 West, according to UTA Police Chief Fred Ross. \n \n He said it is unknown whether the driver at that time was Ricks, but Ross \"[didn't] have any reason to believe\" it was someone else. \n \n That same day, investigators said the pair of suspected kidnappers may have been at the Ramada Inn near 2400 S. State St. in South Salt Lake. The locations are about 2 miles apart. \n \n Anyone spotting the truck is asked not to approach it, but to contact law enforcement immediately. \n \n Ricks is described as a white male, 5 feet, 6 inches, 180 pounds, wearing a long- sleeve shirt, blue jeans and possibly a bright orange safety vest. \n \n Sublette County sheriff's Sgt. Katherine Peterson said Monday there is no \"hard evidence\" linking the kidnappers to Ricks' disappearance, but Wyoming police were looking for the truck as part of their search for weapons that may have been in the Harrisons' possession. Ross said including the truck as part of the search was a way to \"cover all our bases.\" \n \n Meanwhile in Pinedale, Wyo., Dereck James Harrison, 22, and his father, Flint Wayne Harrison, 51, appeared in court Monday afternoon for an extradition hearing. \n \n Both of them invoked their right to an attorney, which means there may be another hearing later this week, Peterson said. Bail was set for each man at $750,000 cash-only. \n \n Flint Harrison had turned himself in at the jail in Pinedale on Saturday and provided information that aided deputies in narrowing down the location of his son, who was captured Saturday night. \n \n Both men were fugitives, wanted for allegedly kidnapping and assaulting a Centerville woman and her four teenage daughters May 10. \n \n The two Harrison men were each charged Wednesday in Utah's 2nd District Court with 10 counts of first-degree-felony aggravated kidnapping. \n \n In another development, Maryann Dalrymple Harrison, 45 — who is Dereck Harrison's mother and the ex-wife of Flint Harrison — waived extradition and will be returned to Utah within about 10 days, Peterson said. \n \n Maryann Harrison was arrested in Pinedale about 6 p.m. Saturday for violating terms of her parole by leaving Utah to travel to Wyoming. \n \n remims@sltrib.com \n \n Twitter: @remims \n \n Reporter Mariah Noble contributed to this story ||||| A helicopter circles as law enforcement officials work east of Highway 189 about 16 miles south of Kemmerer, Wyo., Wednesday, May 18, 2016. Law enforcement officials are looking for a possible connection... (Associated Press) \n \n A helicopter circles as law enforcement officials work east of Highway 189 about 16 miles south of Kemmerer, Wyo., Wednesday, May 18, 2016. Law enforcement officials are looking for a possible connection between a missing Utah Transit Authority worker, whose body was discovered late Tuesday evening,... (Associated Press) \n \n AMERICAN FORK, Utah (AP) — Utah train maintenance worker Kay Porter Ricks lived a regimented life: He went to work at the same time each day, tried to use the same service truck on his route and came home at the same hour. \n \n The morning before he went missing last week, he even returned home to give his wife of 42 years a kiss goodbye to avoid diverting from his daily routine. \n \n So his family knew something was amiss when the 63-year-old Mormon grandfather didn't come from work on May 12 and his truck was later spotted in Wyoming and his cellphone near a station across town, said Richard Massey, a spokesman for the family. \n \n Their worst fears were realized Tuesday when a Wyoming sheriff's deputy found Ricks dead, wearing his work boots and jeans, some 130 miles from the spot in Salt Lake City where he was last seen checking on train tracks. \n \n Now, the FBI and investigators in Utah and Wyoming are trying to determine if a father and son accused of holding a woman and her four teenage daughters hostage had anything to do with his death. \n \n His cause of death has not been disclosed. But Utah Transit Authority Police Chief Fred Ross said it has been ruled a homicide. \n \n Police have not definitively linked Flint Wayne Harrison, 51, and his son Dereck James \"DJ\" Harrison, 22, to Ricks' death. \n \n \"There are some coincidences there that would be impossible to ignore as we continue to investigate,\" Lincoln County Sheriff Shane Johnson told the Deseret News. \n \n Ricks vanished during his night shift a few miles from a Utah house where investigators believe the father and son had been lying low before heading to Wyoming. Ricks' body was found in the same Wyoming county where his work truck was last spotted by surveillance cameras. The county borders the area where the Harrisons were camping before their weekend arrest. \n \n The missing truck could explain how the Harrisons traveled nearly 250 miles from Utah to Wyoming, authorities said. \n \n The deputy who found Ricks was taking one last look after the search had officially ended for the night when he noticed Ricks' boots, Massey said. His body was discovered near a dirt road about 16 miles south of the town of Kemmerer, Wyoming, said Lincoln County Sheriff Shane Johnson. \n \n Authorities still haven't found Ricks' truck but vowed to keep searching. \n \n Massey said authorities haven't told the Ricks family about finding any evidence connecting his disappearance to the Harrisons. He said Ricks' family members who live in the small city of American Fork south of Salt Lake City, are mourning their loss rather than speculating on what happened. Ricks had three grown sons and six grandchildren. \n \n \"The fact that something nefarious may have happened to cause Kay to lose his life is really not the family's focus,\" said Massey. \"There are six grandchildren that greatly miss their grandfather. As you can well imagine, it's difficult explaining to them what has happened to their grandfather.\" \n \n The FBI is assisting authorities, but spokeswoman Sandra Yi Barker couldn't provide any more details \n \n The Harrisons were arrested over the weekend after a five-day search. The father eventually surrendered and led police to the remote camp near Pinedale, Wyoming. \n \n The two are accused of using drugs and tying up a woman and her four teenage daughters in a basement on May 10 because they wrongly thought the mother had reported them to authorities. The family was able to break free and escape. \n \n The Harrisons will be extradited to Utah to face 16 charges each, including kidnapping and drug possession. They are not talking to police, Centerville, Utah, police Lt. Von Steenblik said. \n \n ___ \n \n This story has been corrected to show that Ricks went missing May 12, not May 10, and he lived in American Fork, not Pleasant Grove. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Ben Neary in Cheyenne, Wyoming, contributed to this report. ||||| Please enable Javascript to watch this video \n \n AMERICAN FORK, Utah - Spokesman Richard Massey for the family of UTA employee Kay Ricks, who was found dead in Wyoming, said the family is \"sincerely grateful\" for the support they have been getting from the Utah community and beyond. \n \n However, the family is asking for privacy at this difficult time. \n \n Ricks' loved ones said they are touched by the yellow ribbons popping up around the community in memory of Ricks. The ribbons first went up last week when the man was reported missing. \n \n The family has set up a fund at Wells Fargo, the Kay Porter Ricks Memorial Scholarship Fund, which will help his six grandchildren with their higher education. \n \n \"We are confident that the body that has been found, is that of Kay Ricks,\" Massey said. \n \n UTA eventually confirmed the body is that of Ricks, and police have said they are investigating the death as a homicide. \n \n Massey said at this time the family is focused on supporting each other rather than dwelling on thoughts of revenge or anger. \n \n \"They're not angry with anyone, they're not mad at anyone, they don't want revenge on anybody: They are just trying to stay together as a family and support each other,\" he said. \n \n The family sent Fox 13 this statement:",
    "summary": "– A father and son duo accused of kidnapping a woman and her four teenage daughters in Utah may also be linked to a murder. Two days after the alleged kidnapping on May 10, officials say a 63-year-old train maintenance worker vanished in South Salt Lake, about two miles from where Flint Harrison, 51, and Dereck Harrison, 22, were believed to be hiding out, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. Utah Transit Authority worker Kay Porter Ricks never came home from his night shift on May 12 and was found dead in Wyoming on Tuesday still wearing his work boots, reports the AP. His body—which had been there for days, per KSTU—was found off a dirt road about 120 miles from where the Harrisons camped after fleeing Utah, police say. His death has been ruled a homicide. Police say there is no \"hard evidence\" linking the Harrisons to Ricks' death, but \"there are some coincidences there that would be impossible to ignore as we continue to investigate.\" Though Ricks' cellphone was found on a train platform in Utah, police say his white Ford pickup truck was spotted by surveillance cameras in Wyoming, which might explain how the Harrisons traveled out of state. The truck has not been found, though officials plan to search two lakes with sonar equipment. A rep for Ricks' family says that \"though Kay's body may be dead, they know he lives and that they will see him again,\" per Fox 13. Both Harrisons are being held in Pinedale, Wyo., where their bail is set at $750,000 cash each."

Ambassador Nikki Haley gave anything away about who will be replacing her at the U.N. … or did they? \n \n A lot of people think they may have done just that, and the names floating around are Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. Haley effusively praised them, especially Jared, referring to him as a “hidden genius.” \n \n “Jared is such a hidden genius that no one understands,” said Haley. “What I have done working with him on the Middle East peace plan. it is so unbelievably well done.” \n \n Ahead of the official statement on Haley’s resignation but after the news of it leaked, CNN had already floated the idea that Trump might want Ivanka in the job, noting that she has made many efforts to build communication between Trump and Democrats. And during the presser, Haley cited Kusher’s work on the new NAFTA deal, an international trade agreement the reworking of which involved not just diplomatic relations but negotiation. \n \n Hmmm.

If it were Jared or Ivanka, it hardly requires mentioning that waiting until after the election would be riskier than trying to cram it through now with a seated Republican majority.

Mediaite notes that one hot rumor is that Trump will thus pick either Kushner or daughter Ivanka.

    "document": "One lucky Redditor received a travel book, a stuffed cow, and a donation in her name to a charity, though the Microsoft chairman decided against the iPad on her wishlist. \n \n Microsoft Chairman and Secret Santa Bill Gates. (Credit: CBS) \n \n Bill Gates as Santa Claus? That's the role he played to one girl on Reddit. \n \n Excited and shocked when she learned the source behind her generous gift giving, Redditor Rachel detailed the exchange in a Redditgifts post Wednesday night. Served up by the folks at Reddit, Redditgifts is an online gift exchange where people become Secret Santas by exchanging presents with friends and strangers around the world. \n \n Rachel unwrapped the gifts from her Secret Santa to discover a stuffed animal that she added to her teddy bear collection and a National Geographic coffee table book entitled \"Journeys of a Lifetime.\" Also in the package was a donation to Heifer International made on Rachel's behalf, a gift that she said nailed it since the organization tries to offer an education and other benefits to people in need. \n \n The true identity of Rachel's Secret Santa was finally revealed when she found a photo of Gates holding the stuffed animal and the signed donation sent to Heifer International. An inscription in the book with a \"really nice message\" and note from Gates wishing Rachel a Merry Christmas and a Happy Birthday was the topper. \n \n \"My God. Never in my entire life did I imagine, ever, ever, ever that Bill would get me,\" Rachel wrote in her post. \"I am SO SO thankful for the time, thought ,and energy he put into my gift, and especially thankful for him over-nighting it :)\" \n \n One item on Rachel's wishlist wasn't part of the package -- an Apple iPad. But who needs an iPad when you manage to get Bill Gates as your Secret Santa? ||||| He may not have gifted her the iPad she wanted, but Bill Gates proved a very generous Secret Santa to a Reddit user. NY1227 wrote a post last night to reveal that the RedditGifts' elf-matching service had paired her with the Microsoft founder. Not that she worked it out immediately—well, would you, if your package was addressed to you like this? \n \n It wasn't until the recipient discovered a photo in the package of the software creator turned philanthropist cuddling a cow that she realized who it was from. \n \n As well as gifting a cuddly cow and a travel book, Gates donated a cow, via Heifer International, to a family in the developing world, in her name. \n \n The post is a joy to read. For example: \"My santa had not messaged me, but I knew I was super thorough and have a pretty good posting history so I wasn't too worried that my santa would stiff me. Finally, I received a shipped notification to my email on Monday- I was SO SO SO excited but even more excited when I realized A) my gift was being OVERNIGHTED and B) it was 7 pounds- OMG!\" \n \n Let us reiterate, it is a joy. \"Thank you so much Bill for a fantastic and thoughtful gift. I'd really love to send a thank you card to you, but if not, I hope this post and message suffices. Thank you so much!!!!!! I will think of you every time I read my book, which will find a nice home on my coffee table once I'm done reading it. 10/10, I would receive a gift from Bill Gates again. \" \n \n And finally, she added a postscript: \"Sorry for the apple ipad on my wishlist, that was really awkward.\" ||||| 1. redditgifts is a new way to spread holiday cheer worldwide. \n \n redditgifts is a giant online gift exchange that started connecting internet stranger-friends around the world with one another in 2009. Last year 89,421 people worldwide participated in Secret Santa 2013. \n \n Think about that for a second: 89,421 internet strangers from 160 different countries put their faith in one another and sent gifts around the world. Pretty awesome, right? \n \n Participating is easy. It only takes a few minutes to sign up and create a profile. Once you do, you wait until matching day, when we run a big program that matches each person to someone else in a giant daisy chain. You’ll be given a person’s username, and you can stalk that person (in a friendly way) to find the perfect gift for them and mail it off. Someone else will be doing the same for you, and when you get it, you can post photos of your awesome gift online so we can all celebrate together. ||||| I want to start by giving a HUGE THANK YOU to Mr. Bill Gates for an amazing gift and secret santa experience. Bill- you ROCK (can I call you Bill?! I feel like we're friends now!). I am so very, very grateful for the amazing and thoughtful gift you have picked for me! Not only is the gift PERFECT from anyone, but I am sincerely very appreciative that you took the time to find something so fitting for me. I asked for a return address to send a thank you card to whomever my \"Santa\" was. I see that you did not provide one so I hope this serves as a proper thank you. Regardless, I'd still love to send a personal thank you if you want to give me your mailing address!! \n \n I did not realize my santa was Mr. Bill Gates himself until very far into this. Here's my \"journey\" of discovery, sorry for the length but I thought many might be interested. \n \n My information got pulled about 3 days after elf matching was done. My santa had not messaged me, but I knew I was super thorough and have a pretty good posting history so I wasn't too worried that my santa would stiff me. Finally, I received a shipped notification to my email on Monday- I was SO SO SO excited but even more excited when I realized A) my gift was being OVERNIGHTED and B) it was 7 pounds- OMG! \n \n Of course life is life and I wasn't able to get to the gift until this evening (Wednesday night). I decided to document my journey, starting with the box. The first thing I noticed was a stuffed animal. I didn't know I gave off the stuffed animal vibe, but I excitedly added him to my collection of teddy bears and other delightful friendly creatures. Next, I found the card. Next, I found the card. To me, from Bill. This still had not clicked, by the way, that it was Bill Gates. \n \n I thought Bill sounded like a friendly fellow. In fact, I had this whole image of this poor guy named Bill trying to navigate my wishlist full of makeup, nailpolish, glittery things to buy me. Quite frankly I felt bad for this \"Bill\" since I'm a self identified pain in the ass to shop for. I finally opened the card and realized that \"Bill\" (I use quotes, because like I said, I still didn't realize that this was THE Bill) had donated to a charity on my behalf. \n \n The charity was/is Heifner International. I took a break from my present to research the charity a bit, and now the stuffed animal cow made sense. I was so excited, the cause seemed really worthy and amazing, and it is the season of giving. By the way, the charity \"gives families in need the right tools- such as animals, seeds, clean water, safe stoves or a chance for girls to go to school.\" The last part was/is my favorite, since my master's degree is in education and I am SO into educational benefits for all. It makes me so happy that he was able to donate to a charity on my behalf that helped people with both needs and educational benefits. Nailed it, Bill! \n \n By the way, in case anyone was being nosy it does not say how much he donated to my behalf, but I can only imagine it was QUITE a bit. \n \n But I digress, back to the gift. Still not realizing who was gifting me, I quickly opened the bulk and weight of the gift, which was an amazing and beautiful travel book, \"Journeys of a lifetime.\" I went on and on in my likes and dislikes for my love of travel and seeing the world, and I cannot WAIT to read this. Not only that, but I love pictures and reading up on new places. This gift was perfect! I quickly flipped through it, missing the inscription, message and signature from Bill on the first page, and headed to the final part of my gift. \n \n Once again, To me, From Bill. I opened this and it's a man holding a sign. Oh.... \n \n wait. \n \n holy shit. \n \n time out. \n \n and then it finally hit me. All the presents I just tore open, the charity, then everything-- was from Bill GATES. I quickly went back to the book to see a really nice message and note from Bill wishing me a Merry Christmas and a Happy Birthday (not pictured, because I really want to keep one part of this gift to myself) my jaw hit the EVER LOVING FLOOR. I went back to all the other gifts completely shocked. Then I paused for a minute and thought, what if this is someone screwing with me. Well of course Mr. Bill Gates already thought of this and took a picture of himself with my stuffed animal and a sign and then sent me the stuffed animal and sign. \n \n My god. Never in my entire life did I imagine, ever, ever, ever that Bill would get me. I am SO SO thankful for the time, thought and energy he put into my gift, and especially thankful for him over nighting it :) \n \n I feel SO shocked and excited that not only did I receive a gift from Bill, but it was perfectly and EXACTLY tuned into my interests. My gosh, what a rush!! I cannot express how much I really loved reading about a new charity. By the way everyone, you should go donate too! http://www.heifer.org/ \n \n Thank you so much Bill for a fantastic and thoughtful gift. I'd really love to send a thank you card to you, but if not, I hope this post and message suffices. Thank you so much!!!!!! I will think of you every time I read my book, which will find a nice home on my coffee table once I'm done reading it. \n \n 10/10 would receive gift from Bill Gates again \n \n ps: Sorry for the apple ipad on my wishlist, that was really awkward. \n \n EDIT: I just got home to see this exploded on the news. To everyone requesting interviews with me, I appreciate the thought but I'm not really looking to exploit this into publicity. I've described my gift, my reactions, and my feelings as best as I can through my post and comments. There is really nothing left for me to say, except privately to Bill (I really hope I can call him that), which I have attempted to do. Merry Christmas!",

    "document": "The largest stretch 8 inches. The oldest live nine years. The busiest lay up to 1,200 eggs. \n \n Everywhere they go, people stop to gape. The giant African land snail is a massive mollusk now infesting Miami-Dade County and threatening other parts of Florida. \n \n They ooze in large bushes, gnaw through the stucco and plaster of residential homes and consume at least 500 different plants. The rare breeds of the species even carry a parasitic nematode that can lead to meningitis in humans — although no cases of disease transmission have been documented yet. \n \n Since September 2011, more than 116,000 of the snails have been found in 20 areas speckled throughout the county. \n \n They come from east Africa and have been spread throughout the world from the pet trade, both as a food resource and through accidental introduction. They're considered one of the most dangerous and damaging snails — and they're being openly targeted. \n \n At the state and federal level, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is on a mission to eradicate the snails before they spread through Florida, said Denise Feiber, the public information director of the Division of Plant Industry in Gainesville. \n \n “They're a trifecta,” said Feiber, who's traveled to Miami several times to help dispose of the snails. “They're a risk to property, health and agricultural resources and landscapes.” \n \n Since the hunt began more than a year ago, scientists have scoured targeted neighborhoods, initiated an outreach program to alert residents and started a help line. \n \n The last giant snail outbreak took place in the '60s, when a young boy returned with three from Hawaii and left them in his grandma's garden. They multiplied quickly, taking nine years to exterminate. \n \n Feiber said she doesn't want this eradication project to last that long. \n \n So, on Tuesday and Wednesday, about 15 scientists — 12 of whom were giant snail specialists who traveled from areas as far as California and Canada — gathered at the local plant industry building to review their present progress, address any shortcomings and discuss more efficient extermination methods. \n \n “What we did is we brought in experts from all over the country,” said Trevor Smith, a scientist and bureau chief at the plant industry in town. “The idea was to look at our program in Miami and ask ourselves: How are we doing? I can't think of another meeting where we've had this many African snail specialists together. Some great ideas came out.” \n \n One dealt with improving the bait used to kill the snails. In the past, scientists used an iron-phosphate granule, Smith said, but they were looking for something better, something stronger. \n \n “We've seen there's better metaldehyde products out there that are extremely effective,” he said, “and one of the things we discussed at the seminar is how we were going to incorporate some of these new chemicals into the program.” \n \n Currently, a group of about 50 scientists deal with the Miami infestation hands-on, Feiber said. They examine targeted areas, spread bait and cart the snails they find back to the lab for a freeze death and further testing. \n \n Although the work is difficult and time-consuming, the bait mixture and removal methods are paying off, Feiber said. \n \n “We're still collecting 400 to 500 (snails) a week,” Feiber said, “but the good news is, more and more are deceased when we find them.” \n \n So far, the species hasn't advanced to other metropolitan areas like Tampa, Orlando and Fort Myers. \n \n But Smith said he's concerned. Despite the present containment, he worries that other cities aren't aware of the gravity of the situation. \n \n “I think it has the capability to travel up to North Florida,” he said. “You could ask anybody in South Florida and they know about it. It's in the papers. It's on TV. We have billboards, we have fliers. It's on the side of the buses. But in the rest of Florida … I'm not so sure.” \n \n Future outreach programs in the next year will be focused on these areas, he said. \n \n In the meantime, everyone keeps their eyes peeled. \n \n Although the snails are behemoths, they blend in well with their surroundings, Feiber said, and they can be transferred by people. If someone moved a plant that a giant snail nestled into to a different part of the state, the infestation could spread rapidly because of the snail's speedy reproduction rate, she added. \n \n “It's definitely something that we have to keep our eye on,” she said, cradling a deceased snail's shell in her office. “This snail is one of the most-feared invasive pests in the world.” ||||| A Giant African land snail is seen in this handout picture from the Florida Department of Agriculture Division of Plant Industry taken September 19, 2011. \n \n A Giant African land snail is seen in this handout picture from the Florida Department of Agriculture Division of Plant Industry taken September 9, 2011. \n \n ORLANDO, Florida South Florida is fighting a growing infestation of one of the world's most destructive invasive species: the giant African land snail, which can grow as big as a rat and gnaw through stucco and plaster. \n \n More than 1,000 of the mollusks are being caught each week in Miami-Dade and 117,000 in total since the first snail was spotted by a homeowner in September 2011, said Denise Feiber, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. \n \n Residents will soon likely begin encountering them more often, crunching them underfoot as the snails emerge from underground hibernation at the start of the state's rainy season in just seven weeks, Feiber said. \n \n The snails attack \"over 500 known species of plants ... pretty much anything that's in their path and green,\" Feiber said. \n \n In some Caribbean countries, such as Barbados, which are overrun with the creatures, the snails' shells blow out tires on the highway and turn into hurling projectiles from lawnmower blades, while their slime and excrement coat walls and pavement. \n \n \"It becomes a slick mess,\" Feiber said. \n \n A typical snail can produce about 1,200 eggs a year and the creatures are a particular pest in homes because of their fondness for stucco, devoured for the calcium content they need for their shells. \n \n The snails also carry a parasitic rat lungworm that can cause illness in humans, including a form of meningitis, Feiber said, although no such cases have yet been identified in the United States. \n \n EXOTIC INVASION \n \n The snails' saga is something of a sequel to the Florida horror show of exotic species invasions, including the well-known infestation of giant Burmese pythons, which became established in the Everglades in 2000. There is a long list of destructive non-native species that thrive in the state's moist, subtropical climate. \n \n Experts gathered last week in Gainesville, Florida, for a Giant African Land Snail Science Symposium, to seek the best ways to eradicate the mollusks, including use of a stronger bait approved recently by the federal government. \n \n Feiber said investigators were trying to trace the snail infestation source. One possibility being examined is a Miami Santeria group, a religion with West African and Caribbean roots, which was found in 2010 to be using the large snails in its rituals, she said. But many exotic species come into the United States unintentionally in freight or tourists' baggage. \n \n \"If you got a ham sandwich in Jamaica or the Dominican Republic, or an orange, and you didn't eat it all and you bring it back into the States and then you discard it, at some point, things can emerge from those products,\" Feiber said. \n \n Authorities are expanding a series of announcements on buses, billboards and in movie theaters urging the public to be on the lookout. \n \n The last known Florida invasion of the giant mollusks occurred in 1966, when a boy returning to Miami from a vacation in Hawaii brought back three of them, possibly in his jacket pockets. His grandmother eventually released the snails into her garden where the population grew in seven years to 17,000 snails. The state spent $1 million and 10 years eradicating them. \n \n Feiber said many people unfamiliar with the danger viewed the snails as cute pets. \n \n \"They're huge, they move around, they look like they're looking at you ... communicating with you, and people enjoy them for that,\" Feiber said. \"But they don't realize the devastation they can create if they are released into the environment where they don't have any natural enemies and they thrive.\" \n \n (Editing by David Adams and Peter Cooney)",
    "summary": "– No, this is not a 1970s B-movie: South Florida really is dealing with an invasion of giant African land snails. The beastly mollusks can grow as large as rats (the biggest measure eight inches long, the Ocala Star-Banner reports), and can eat their way through plaster and stucco. More than 1,000 are already being caught per week in Miami-Dade County, and that number is set to swell when the mollusks end their underground hibernation, Reuters reports. Since September 2011, a disturbing 117,000 have been caught. The invasion isn't just gross, it's also problematic, a Florida Department of Agriculture rep explains, because the snails eat \"over 500 known species of plants ... pretty much anything that's in their path and green.\" And that's not all: Their shells can blow out tires; their slime can make sidewalks slick; and they carry a lungworm that can give humans meningitis (though no US cases have been reported). They're also tough to eradicate, since one typically produces about 1,200 eggs per year and can live up to nine years. The last invasion, in 1966, took $1 million—and about a decade—to deal with. Experts from all around the US held a symposium last week to discuss solutions. Among them: stronger bait."

In most cases, though, it's just a single animal that is beached, not a whole pod. \n \n It's not fully known why whales or dolphins strand, the agency said. Possible reasons might be sickness, navigational errors, falling tides or being chased by a predator. \n \n Also over the weekend, 12 pygmy whales were found stranded at the northern tip of North Island. Four of them have died. \n \n There are hopes that the remaining eight can still be rescued and efforts are under way by local marine mammal charity Project Jonah. \n \n The group said it planned to re-float the whales on Tuesday and has asked for volunteers to help. \n \n On another North Island beach, a 15m (50ft) sperm whale died on Saturday morning. ||||| More than 140 pilot whales die in 'heartbreaking' New Zealand stranding \n \n More than 140 pilot whales have died on a remote New Zealand beach, the latest in a recent string of whale strandings and deaths in the country. \n \n On Saturday night the Department of Conservation [DoC] was informed of a mass whale stranding in Mason Bay on Stewart Island. \n \n A hiker camping in the remote location told authorities of the tragedy, with the number of whales equating to two pods. \n \n DOC Rakiura operations manager Ren Leppens said at least half of the whales were dead by the time staff arrived at the scene. \n \n Indonesia: dead whale had 1,000 pieces of plastic in stomach Read more \n \n “Sadly, the likelihood of being able to successfully refloat the remaining whales was extremely low.

New Zealand is considered a \"hot spot\" for the stranding of marine creatures, though it's typically single animals that are found, not multitudes of them. Researchers are still trying to fully understand what causes the whales to wash up on shores there, and so far the DOC suspects factors that include \"sickness, navigational error, geographical features, a rapidly falling tide, being chased by a predator, or extreme weather.\" Stewart Island in particular could be \"confusing\" for the whales, the manager of a whale rescue group says, messing with their echolocation-dependent communications system due to its \"gently shelving waters,\" per Stuff.co.nz.

During that second round, according to Philly.com, he became aware his caddie had used the slope function on his distance measuring device. This is a violation of Rule 14-3. \n \n Crawford alerted a rules official of his caddie’s misstep, which would normally dock him two strokes. The only problem was that his caddie used the slope function multiple times during the round, which brought the punishment even further: disqualification. \n \n Chris Crawford was competing in his fifth U.S. Amateur and was in good position to make the cut for match play when he was disqualified. Getty Images // Gregory Shamus \n \n ESPN’s Bob Harig tracked down Crawford for a comment Tuesday evening. \"I was a little flustered and knew something was wrong,\" Crawford told Harig. \"I asked my caddie what the deal was with his range finder. When he said it had a slope adjustment, I knew instantly that I had to disqualify myself. I notified the walking scorer in my group, and after getting in touch with a rules official I learned it would have been a 2-shot penalty if I had used it just once, but the second time is a disqualification. I have my own range finder and I know the rule, but I didn't think his would have that.\" \n \n According to Harig’s report, Crawford was 2 under for his second round (1 over overall) when the disqualification occurred. Eventually, 4 over was good enough to advance to a playoff for the match play competition. \n \n \"I didn’t gain an advantage, but I know the Rules,\" he told Harig. \"I knew what the rule was and I didn’t have a choice.\" ||||| Golf's complicated rulebook found another victim Tuesday, this time at the U.S. Amateur, where former Drexel golfer Chris Crawford was disqualified for using a distance-measuring device that had an activated slope reader accessed by his fill-in caddie. \n \n Crawford, 23, who lives outside of Philadelphia, got off to a good start earlier in his second round of stroke-play qualifying at Bel Air Country Club in Los Angeles and was in position to make the 64-player match play when he heard his caddie mention something about slope when getting a yardage from his distance-measuring device. \n \n \"I was a little flustered and knew something was wrong,\" Crawford said via phone on Tuesday night. \"I asked my caddie what the deal was with his range finder.

The information that Crawford was given caused him to believe it was being used; he checked and it was on. If it had been turned off, there would have been no violation. But instead, Crawford was deemed in violation of Rule 14-3 \"for multiple uses of a distance-measuring device with the slope feature activated by his caddie,\" according to the United States Golf Association, which administers the tournament. \n \n In 2014, the USGA began allowing the use of such devices as part of a local rule that has been adopted for all of its amateur events but not the U.S. Open, U.S. Women's Open or U.S. Senior Open. Distance-measuring devices are not allowed on the PGA, European or LPGA tours, and not on the Web.com Tour except in some experimental instances. \n \n The stroke-play rounds of the U.S. Amateur were contested at Bel-Air and Riviera Country Club, where the match-play portion of the tournament begins Wednesday. \n \n Crawford said he had intended to bring his own caddie to Los Angeles for the tournament, but that he became ill. So he hired a local caddie on Monday at Riviera, where he shot 73, and another Tuesday at Bel-Air, where he was 2 under for his round and 1 over for the tournament when he discovered the infraction. \n \n \"I was so upset and flustered by the situation,\" said Crawford, who did not name the caddie. \"I know some people in that situation would have gone berserk.

A group of activists have started to collect money to repair the penis-shaped rock formation and... (Associated Press) \n \n HELSINKI (AP) — Activists are collecting money to repair a penis-shaped rock formation in southern Norway after the popular tourist attraction was found badly damaged. \n \n Joggers discovered Saturday that the Trollpikken rock formation had cracked and noted drilling holes in the rock — something that experts say strongly suggests the rock was deliberately vandalized. \n \n By Sunday, over 500 people had donated nearly 90,000 Norwegian kroner ($10,600) to fix the formation located south of the southern coastal city of Stavanger. \n \n Activist Kjetil Bentsen told public broadcaster NRK that he was convinced the Trollpikken \"will be rebuilt\" with donated money. \n \n Police are looking for tips to find the person or persons who did it. They could face a one-year prison sentence for a serious environmental crime. ||||| An appalled but enthusiastic group of activists is determined that their local landmark, a stone formation called “Trollpikken” that resembled an erect penis, will rise again. Police are searching, meanwhile, for whoever literally cut it off over the weekend, with the culprits facing six years in prison for environmental vandalism if caught. \n \n Reaction has been swift after a group of joggers found the tourist attraction in Eigersund, south of Stavanger, badly damaged on Saturday morning. Kjetil Bentsen, who’s been leading efforts to make Trollpikken a more popular tourist attraction in the hills of Norway’s southwest coast, told local newspaper Dalane Tidende that “someone” drilled holes into its base “and cut off the whole formation.” \n \n Remnants including metal bolts were found left at the site, while Bentsen said there were several signs that clearly show how someone wanted to destroy Trollpikken. Its name has been roughly translated by its supporters to “The Troll Cock.” \n \n “This is terribly sad, and I’m appalled that someone could do something like this,” Bentsen said. \n \n Both the chief of the regional tourism promotion organization Destination Stavanger and local police have been working to attract more attention to Trollpikken, in competition with other unusual rock formations in the area including Trolltunga and Kjeragbolten. Police and local officials have been concerned about the crowds of poorly prepared tourists who attempt the hike to Trolltunga especially, and hoped to divert some of them to the lesser-known Trollpikken that involves a much easier hike. Trollpikken could also provide an alternative to Preikestolen, yet another tourist magnet not far from Stavanger that can be extremely overcrowded during the summer months. \n \n Police were launching an investigation, confirmed Magnar Sandstøl, acting chief of the Eigersund police station. Tor Helge Stavik of the Sør-Vest Police District that covers the entire southwest region of Norway told TV2 that “this type of violation of the law carries potential punishment of up to six years in prison. \n \n A local building contractor told TV2 it was no problem to re-erect the landmark. “Folks have been saying it’s destroyed forever but that’s not true,” said Sverre Garpestad of the firm Bertelsen & Garpestad. He claimed it would be “a simple job” to fasten the stone back into place by drilling bolts and injecting a special form of mortar into “tunnels” that would secure it. “The work can be done in an hour if we use a helicopter,” Garpestad said. \n \n The Trollpikken enthusiasts quickly launched a fundraising effort and had already raised more NOK 74,583 from 424 donors by early Sunday morning. A local sporting goods store had pledged NOK 10,000 and was urging others to follow suit. A local geologist was calling for price estimates for the repair job and doesn’t think Trollpikken will lose its value as a tourist attraction. If anything, all the fuss over the vandalism has given rise to enormous publicity. \n \n That prompted some pundits, who were having fun with the story in the Norwegian media, to comment that Trollpikken was probably in safe hands. “Absolutely,” claimed Garpestad. “We have the Viagra that’s needed.” \n \n newsinenglish.no/Nina Berglund",

    "document": "I love reading books on art. Not just the kind with pretty pictures, either. But the kind with words. It baffles me how few of my classes during art school actually had required texts. Thankfully I was lucky enough to stumble into the world of art books on my own, and I believe I’m a better artist for it. \n \n Here are ten books that I sincerely believe every artist out there should purchase and read—at least once. \n \n Art & Fear If you’ve ever started to have thoughts in your head about “am I talented enough?” or “why do I bother making art?” then you need to read this book. You also need to read this book if you haven’t had those thoughts yet. It’s a quick read and very enjoyable. I don’t think any book will get you back to your easel faster than this one. \n \n The Art Spirit Sometimes I read too many books on technique, so I like to balance it out with some theory and emotion. Robert Henri’s The Art Spirit is a classic. You won’t find out the “best way to draw anime” in this book, but you might just discover why you’re making art in the first place. \n \n How Pictures Work It’s small, simple, and entirely profound. In my opinion the single best book on composition available. The illustrations are all made with cut paper, so all frills are left aside, leaving only pure design and composition. Molly Bang uses a number of comparison pictures to show you how design actually works. You can probably sit down and read it in one go, but you’ll find yourself returning to it time and time again. \n \n Imaginative Realism Though this might, at first glance, seem to lean heavily towards the genre illustrators in our midst, this book is great for artists of all types. James Gurney is a phenomenal painter and an equally fantastic teacher. He writes clearly and to the point. No matter what sort of art you want to do, I think you’ll find something pertinent in here. \n \n Color and Light This is James Gurney’s second book, and it’s easily as good as the first. I’ve done quite a lot of searching for good books on color and light and didn’t find anything useful enough to recommend… until this. James Gurney has done extensive research into how light and color work in the real world and how it applies to art. He balances the scientific understanding with artistic flare in the most eloquent way possible. And while I’m on the subject let me recommend these two DVDs put out by Gnomon: The Mechanics of Color and Practical Light and Color. Both helped me enormously when it came to learning color theory. \n \n Hawthorne on Painting Short & sweet. A small bite-sized book with tons of little nuggets of wisdom. It can be a little off-putting in its format (mostly transcribed critiques of images, but without the images), but it’s worth it. Some people also find it a little wishy-washy and not solidly academic enough, but I find it completely refreshing and hopeful. I don’t think any other book has been able to instill quite the passion for painting that this book exudes. \n \n Alla Prima Written by one of the most influential living artists, Alla Prima is an essential tome of observational painting. Richard Schmid can, at times, come across as all-knowing to some people, but he does so with a fair bit of justification. His own skills at painting are incredible and he does a remarkably good job at putting everything into words. It’s the priciest book on this list, but it’s worth every penny. \n \n Oil Painting Techniques and Materials It can feel a little dated at times—like when Harold Speed talks about the “new brush” known as a “filbert”—but it’s a timeless book. Anyone starting out painting and looking for guidance should pick this up. The more advanced readers can find some equally useful techniques as well. \n \n The Practice and Science of Drawing Also written by Harold Speed, this is a classic drawing book. It covers design as well, but all through the lens of drawing. Since drawing is the basis for all that we artists do, it makes sense to do a little reading on the subject. ||||| I’ve had it. \n \n I will no longer encourage aspiring artists to attend art school. I just won’t do it. Unless you’re given a full ride scholarship (or have parents with money to burn), attending art school is a waste of your money. \n \n I have a diploma from the best public art school in the nation. Prior to that I attended the best private art school in the nation. I’m not some flaky, disgruntled art graduate, either. I have a quite successful career, thankyouverymuch. \n \n But I am saddened and ashamed at art schools and their blatant exploitation of students. Graduates are woefully ill-prepared for the realities of being professional artists and racked with obscene amounts of debt. By their own estimation, the cost of a four year education at RISD is $245,816. As way of comparison, the cost of a diploma from Harvard Law School is a mere $236,100. \n \n This is embarrassing. It’s downright shameful. That any art school should deceive its students into believing that this is a smart decision is cruel and unusual. \n \n Artists are neither doctors nor lawyers. We do not, on average, make huge six-figure salaries. We can make livable salaries, certainly. Even comfortable salaries. But we ain’t usually making a quarter mil a year. Hate to break it to you. An online debt repayment calculator recommended a salary exceeding $400,000 in order to pay off a RISD education within 10 years. \n \n Don’t do it. \n \n Don’t start your career with debilitating debt. \n \n Please. I beg you. Think long and hard whether you’re willing to pay student loan companies $3000 every single month for the next 10 years. \n \n You’ve got other options. \n \n You don’t have to go to college to be an artist. Not once have I needed my diploma to get a job. Nobody cares. The education is all that matters. The work that you produce should be your sole concern. \n \n There are excellent atelier schools all over the world that offer superior education for a mere fraction of the price. Here are a few: \n \n There are more. Many, many more. And none of them will cost nearly as much as a traditional four year school. \n \n And then there are the online options. The availability of drawing and painting resources is incredible. \n \n Sitting at a computer I have direct access to artists all over the world. I have the combined wisdom of the artistic community to pull from at my leisure. For less than a few grand a year I can view more educational material than I would see at any art school. You can get a year of access to all of the Gnomon Workshop’s videos for the cost of a few days at the average art school. \n \n With all of these options it can be a little daunting. So you know what? I’ve come up with a plan for you. Do this: \n \n The $10k Ultimate Art Education \n \n There. For less than a quarter of the tuition for RISD you’ve got yourself a killer education. You’ve received more quality, focused education than I think you’ll find at any art school. \n \n Moving forward \n \n There has never been a better time to be an artist. I’m inspired by the sheer quantity and quality of internet resources available to artists. \n \n But I encourage all aspiring artists to think long and hard about their options. Student loans are unforgivable through bankruptcy and can wreck your financial future. Establishing a career while under the unceasing brutality of student loans makes an already difficult task nearly impossible. \n \n Find another path. Art is a wonderful, beautiful, fulfilling pursuit. Don’t ruin it with a mountain of debt.",
    "summary": "– Move over, law school: There's a new worthless degree in town, at least according to Noah Bradley. The artist, writing on Medium.com, gets right to the point: \"Art school is a waste of your money\" (emphasis his). Though Bradley himself attended two prestigious art schools, he's not some bitter unsuccessful grad. His career is chugging along just fine, but he finds himself \"saddened and ashamed at art schools and their blatant exploitation of students.\" The number-crunching reality: Four years at Rhode Island School of Design cost $245,816, he writes, which is nearly $10,000 more than you'd spend getting a degree from Harvard Law. You can support yourself, even comfortably, as an artist. But not if there's a $3,000 student loan payment that comes due ... every month ... for 10 years. And guess how many times Bradley's diploma has landed him a job? Zero. \"Nobody cares,\" he writes. But an art education is still key. You just don't need to go to college to get one.

(Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the briefing by CIA Director Gina Haspel on the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi (all times local): \n \n 1:25 p.m. \n \n Senators leaving a briefing with CIA Director Gina Haspel say they are even more convinced that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was involved in the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. \n \n Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said he believes if the crown prince were put on trial, a jury would find him guilty in \"about 30 minutes.\" \n \n Tuesday's briefing comes as the Senate weighs punishing the longtime Middle East ally over the killing. President Donald Trump has equivocated over who is to blame. Frustrated with the administration's response, senators voted last week to move forward on a resolution curtailing U.S. backing for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. \n \n South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said there is \"zero chance\" the crown prince wasn't involved in Khashoggi's death. \n \n ___ \n \n 12 p.m. \n \n CIA Director Gina Haspel has briefed Senate leaders on the slaying of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi as senators weigh punishing the longtime Middle East ally over the killing. \n \n The CIA director met with a small group of senators, including the chairmen and ranking senators on the key national security committees. \n \n Senators from both parties were angry last week that Haspel didn't attend a closed-door session with top administration officials about Khashoggi's killing and the U.S. response, which many senators have said is lacking. \n \n Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis led the earlier briefing and tried to dissuade senators from punishing Saudi Arabia with a resolution to curtail U.S. backing for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Human rights groups say the war is wreaking havoc on the country and subjecting civilians to indiscriminate bombing. ||||| WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of senior senators said on Tuesday that a classified briefing by the C.I.A. director had only solidified their belief that Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, ordered the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi. \n \n Prince Mohammed “is a wrecking ball,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told reporters after an hourlong briefing by the C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel. “I think he’s complicit in the murder of Mr. Khashoggi to the highest level possible.” \n \n Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the Appropriations Committee chairman, echoed that “all evidence points to that, that all this leads back to the crown prince.” \n \n “This is conduct that none of us in America would approve of in any way,” Mr. Shelby said. \n \n The clear and unusually biting assessment put Republican senators at odds with the White House, which has steadfastly refused to cast blame on Saudi Arabia’s leadership for the grisly death of Mr. Khashoggi, an American resident and Washington Post columnist. His killing prompted international outrage over the kingdom’s heavy-handed tactics and renewed attention to the Saudi-led war in Yemen. ||||| Senators: Saudi Crown Prince Was Behind Killing Of Jamal Khashoggi \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP \n \n After a briefing from CIA Director Gina Haspel, Senate leaders promptly declared Tuesday they were convinced that Saudi Arabia's crown prince was behind the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. \n \n Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \"is a wrecking ball. I think he is complicit in the murder of Khashoggi in the highest possible level,\" said Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican. \n \n Graham was just one of several senators, Republican and Democrat, who delivered blistering attacks on Saudi Arabia and the crown prince following the closed-door briefing. The Saudis have acknowledged that government officials were responsible for the killing but describe it as a rogue operation and say the crown prince was not involved. \n \n \"I have zero question in my mind that the crown prince ordered the killing, monitored the killing, knew exactly what was happening,\" said Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican. \"If he was in front of a jury, he would be convicted in 30 minutes. Guilty. So the question is, 'What do we do about that?'\" \n \n The sharp response from prominent Senate Republicans will increase the pressure on President Trump, who has defended the crown prince and the U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia. \n \n \"If we abandon Saudi Arabia, it would be a terrible mistake,\" Trump said on Nov. 20, when he released a lengthy statement. \"We're with Saudi Arabia. We're staying with Saudi Arabia.\" \n \n The president has been briefed by the CIA, but his takeaway was dramatically different from that of the senators. \n \n \"It could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event — maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Trump said. \"That being said, we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi.\" \n \n Last week, senators received a briefing from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mattis said there was no \"smoking gun\" implicating the Saudi crown prince. Pompeo offered similar remarks, saying there was \"no direct reporting\" making the link. \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/AP Patrick Semansky/AP \n \n Senators were upset that Haspel did not appear with Mattis and Pompeo, which led to Tuesday's session. \n \n Graham said there was no doubt in his mind after Haspel's briefing. \n \n \"There's not a smoking gun; there's a smoking saw,\" said Graham, referring to reports that Khashoggi's body was dismembered by a bone saw after he was killed at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. \"It is zero chance — zero — that this happened without the crown prince.\" \n \n Khashoggi, who was living near Washington and contributing to The Washington Post, was killed on Oct. 2 when he went into the consulate for paperwork related to his planned marriage. \n \n Graham also said that he would not support the current U.S. military efforts to support Saudi Arabia in its war against Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Senate voted last week to debate the U.S. assistance, and additional Senate action is expected in the coming days. \n \n The U.S. began helping the Saudis when they entered the war more than three years ago, providing weapons, training, intelligence and targeting information for the Saudi bombing campaign. \n \n The war is widely seen as a stalemate and Yemen, an impoverished country even in times of peace, is suffering the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Millions are suffering severe food shortages and are at risk of starvation, according to aid groups. \n \n The CIA has not commented publicly on its assessment of the Khashoggi killing, and Haspel spoke to just a small number of Senate leaders in a closed session. \n \n But many details had already leaked. Those familiar with the CIA report said the agency believes the crown prince was probably linked to the killing. \n \n Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said the briefing \"reinforced the need for a strong response to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.\" \n \n He also said that Haspel \"should brief the full Senate without delay.\" \n \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, told The Wall Street Journal on Monday that \"no response is certainly not appropriate. Looking away is not appropriate. But a complete fracture with Saudi Arabia, in my view, is not in our best interests.\" \n \n He added: \"We're looking for an appropriate response that doesn't completely fracture the relationship.\"",

He was then confronted with allegations that surfaced on social media after the awards show. \n \n He first addressed a since-deleted tweet from “The Breakfast Club” star Ally Sheedy, 55, that questioned why he was allowed to attend the Globes. \n \n “I have no idea what I did to Ally Sheedy,” Franco said. \n \n James Franco accused of inappropriate sexual behavior \n \n “I directed her in a play off Broadway. I had nothing but a great time with her and I have total respect for her,” Franco told Colbert. \n \n Franco continued by telling Colbert that unspecified sexual assault claims spreading on Twitter were “not accurate.” \n \n Franco snagged best actor for portraying Tommy Wiseau in “The Disaster Artist,” which depicts the making of the cult-hit flick “The Room.” \n \n Colbert challenged Franco by first asking about the contradiction of wearing a Time’s Up pin to support victims of sexual misconduct during the entertainment gala. Franco said he supported people “coming out and being able to have a voice because they didn’t have a voice for so long.” \n \n James Franco’s TimesTalk event canceled after misconduct claims \n \n He contended the point of both movements, including the viral #MeToo campaign, is to listen. \n \n “In my life, I pride myself on taking responsibility for things that I’ve done. I have to do that to maintain my well being. I do it whenever I know that there is something wrong and needs to be changed,” Franco said. \n \n “I can’t live if there’s restitution to be made.

I think that’s how that works,” he added. \n \n Stars accused of sexual harassment and assault \n \n The Golden Globes kicked off the Time’s Up initiative launched by more than 300 actress that aims to fight sexual harassment and assault in the workplace. \n \n After Franco’s film victory, several actresses accused him of sexual misconduct. \n \n Violet Paley claimed the actor sexually assaulted her and tried to lure her 17-year-old friend to his hotel room. \n \n \"Cute #TimesUp pin James Franco. Remember the time you pushed my head down in a car towards your exposed penis & that other time you told my friend to come to your hotel when she was 17? After you had already been caught doing that to a different 17 year old?\" she wrote on Twitter. \n \n Earlier on Tuesday, Paley claimed that Franco called and apologized well before she penned her tweet. \n \n \"A couple weeks ago, James offered me & a few other girls an overdue, annoyed, convenient phone 'apology,'\" she tweeted. \"I don’t accept, but maybe some other people’s lives would be made easier if he donated all of his earnings from “The Disaster Artist” to RAINN.\" \n \n Sarah Tither-Kaplan, a former student at Franco’s acting school, claimed that he asked her to strip down on set for only $100 per day after she signed a \"vague and general at best\" contract. \n \n After backlash to the claims mounted, the New York Times canceled a TimesTalk event scheduled with Franco for Wednesday. \n \n “The event was intended to be a discussion of the making of the film, 'The Disaster Artist.' Given the controversy surrounding recent allegations, we're no longer comfortable proceeding in that vein,” the Times said in a statement to the Daily News. \n \n Sign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails privacy policy Thanks for subscribing!",

    "document": "You see it happen in all the major soccer tournaments: As a penalty shot is being taken, the goalkeeper leaps in one direction and the striker deftly kicks the ball into the opposite corner. Such fruitless dives are inevitable because the goalie has no time to see which way the kick is going—he has to start the dive before then if he is to have any chance of saving it. The best strategy would be to choose randomly, but, according to researchers in the United Kingdom, goalkeepers aren't very good at that. Instead, they fall victim to a misjudgment called the gambler's fallacy. Strikers taking penalties should take note, the researchers say, because they could score more goals against goalies that make this mistake. \n \n Penalty kicks, as the name implies, are normally a punishment for a serious infringement of the rules, such as a deliberate foul on an attacking player in the goal area. The ball is placed on a spot 11 meters from the goal. A player from the team that was fouled runs up and has a free shot at goal. In knockout tournaments, such as the World Cup, if the score is tied at the end of a match, the winner may be decided by a penalty shootout. The two teams take turns shooting at goal—using a different player for each kick—and the winner is the side with the highest score after five shots each. (If they’re still tied, they keep shooting.) \n \n Previous studies on penalty kicks have indicated that goalkeepers must make up their minds which way to move before they see the ball fly off the kicker's foot, either by watching the body movements of the kicker to anticipate his kick or simply by committing to one direction or the other. Cognitive neuroscientist Patrick Haggard of University College London says that because a kicker may try to disguise his true intentions, by and large the goalkeeper's decision is a simple guess. Game theory—a branch of mathematics that deals with competitive systems such as sport, economics, and ecology—says the best strategy is to decide randomly, as any regularity could be exploited by the kicker. \n \n Haggard and his Ph.D. student Erman Misirlisoy looked at keepers' dive patterns in all 37 penalty shootouts in World Cup and European Cup matches between 1976 and 2012. They noticed that, after a ball had been aimed to one side, keepers were more likely to dive the other way for the next ball, and the odds increased if a second or third ball had gone to the same side. For example, after three balls had been directed to one side, goalkeepers directed more than 70% of their dives for the fourth ball the opposite way, the team reports online today in Current Biology. This is a classic statistical error called the gambler's fallacy. If two outcomes are equally likely, a long run of one outcome makes people instinctively expect the other in the next trial. \n \n If kickers anticipated this behavior, they could score more penalties, Haggard says. But they don't seem to do so. When the researchers looked at patterns in the directions of the incoming shots, they appeared entirely random. One reason for this, they suggest, may be that in a penalty shootout successive kicks are taken by different players, but the same goalkeeper faces them all. So perhaps players, waiting for their turn at the penalty spot, should take note of which way their teammates shoot before them. \n \n Haggard says that the gambler's fallacy may have a role in other contests on and off the sports field, such as in business decisions, but the penalty shootout is an unusually pure example of where “the gambler's fallacy is one of the few things that could allow one side to have an advantage over the other.” \n \n Sports psychologist Michael Bar-Eli of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, in Israel, who was not involved in the research, describes the paper as “very interesting” but says that, if a kicker does his job properly, there is little a goalkeeper can do anyway. In two studies, one by his own group, not one penalty kicked into the upper third of the goal was saved. “Everybody talks about 'a game' in a game-theoretical sense, which is going on between the shooter and the goalkeeper,” he explains. “But the shooter can take the goalkeeper out of the game by shooting to the two upper corners. There, the chances of goalkeepers are literally 0%—they are simply unable to reach the ball.” ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.",
    "summary": "– Goalkeepers, it seems, fall victim to a classic problem faced by gamblers—and during a penalty shootout, it could cost them the match. The \"gambler's fallacy\" is the mistaken idea that, given a pair of outcomes, a string of one means the other is \"due\" to occur. For instance, as Discover notes, if you have a series of coin flips that land on heads, you might think a tails has got to be coming soon. Goalies appear to think that way when it comes to penalty kicks, Science reports. When a player takes a penalty shot, a goalie essentially has to guess where the ball is going to go with little information. To fend off opponents, goalies should ideally choose randomly, thus preventing the other team from figuring out a pattern. But when researchers reviewed major international games from 1976 to 2012, they found that goalies tended to go in the direction opposite where the ball was last kicked. Knowing that could help kickers score more goals, Science notes. (As for gamblers, it may help to be aware of the fallacy—which helps fuel apparent losing streaks, this study suggests.)"

    "document": "Physical Fitness Helps Young Adolescents Prevent Depression (Photo : Reuters) \n \n Young adolescents can ward off depression by staying physically fit, especially the middle-school girls, a new study reveals. \n \n The researchers at the University of North Texas conducted a survey on 437 students from six middle schools in a metropolitan county in North Texas. Out of the total, 55 percent were girls. Based on the survey, they found that physically-fit sixth-graders were less likely to report feeling depressed on being promoted to the seventh grade. \n \n Like Us on Facebook \n \n As part of the study, the participants were made to answer questions pertaining to symptoms of depression and fitness. Each of them was weighed and completed a shuttle-based run. This is a fitness testing procedure that involves short bursts of speed. The participants included 89 percent whites, 9 percent African-Americans and 27 percent Hisapnics. \n \n \"A student's physical activity level may change from week to week, whereas fitness is a result of more prolonged physical activity,\" said Camilo Ruggero, PhD, of the University of North Texas. \"Assessing the students' body mass index, how well they performed on a shuttle-run test and their own feelings of personal fitness helps to give us a more complete picture of each student's fitness level.\" \n \n The researchers noticed that 28 percent of the girls in sixth grade and 29 percent in seventh grade exhibited elevated symptoms of depression. Among boys, 22 percent faced high symptoms of depression in the seventh grade and 19 percent in the eighth grade. Among both girls and boys, the powerful predictor of depression in the seventh grade was having had symptoms of depression in the sixth grade. They found that fitness was a key factor in controlling depression a year later. \n \n After considering existing symptoms of depression and weight, sixth graders who did well on cardio-respiratory fitness tests were less likely to feel depressed when they surveyed the seventh grade. \n \n \"Depression that begins at this time can lead to chronic or recurring depression in later years,\" he said. \"Fitness programs are one way to help prevent depression in middle-schoolers, but schools should also use other interventions, such as one-on-one or group therapy, that more directly address symptom treatment among depressed adolescents.\" \n \n The study was presented at the American Psychological Association's 122nd Annual Convention. ||||| By Tara Haelle \n \n HealthDay Reporter \n \n THURSDAY, Aug. 7, 2014 (HealthDay News) -- The more fit middle-school girls are, the less likely they may be to develop symptoms of depression, according to a recent study. \n \n Although the effect of fitness on depression was small, improvements in fitness may be part of an overall strategy for reducing the risk of depression in middle-schoolers, according to Camilo Ruggero, lead researcher and an assistant professor of psychology at the University of North Texas. Other strategies might include school-based or family therapy, which can both treat and help prevent depression in at-risk kids. \n \n \"Fitness is not a cure-all, but it's a small piece of a larger problem,\" said Ruggero. He noted that depression is also linked to a higher body mass index (BMI), a measurement used to assess if a person has a healthy weight for their height. In addition, middle school is a time when fitness levels drop off, weight increases and depression increases. \"That's why we're so focused on that period,\" he said. \n \n \"We don't know exactly why there is a link [between fitness levels and depression], but it is probably a number of things,\" Ruggero said. \"It might be better self-esteem, healthier weight or getting more positive reinforcements that go along with being active, and/or it could be more biological. We know certain proteins and hormones associated with less depression respond to increased exercise.\" \n \n He said the relationship might be reciprocal, too: the researchers also found that depression among sixth-grade boys predicted poorer fitness in seventh grade. \n \n There was also a trend between fitness levels and depression in boys but it was not statistically significant. Less depression occurs among boys in general, so the effect may have been harder to detect, according to Ruggero. He suspects a study using a larger number of boys might show a stronger link, though it would likely still be modest. \n \n The findings were presented Thursday at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association in Washington, D.C. Findings presented at meetings are generally considered preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.",
    "summary": "– The more fit a child is, the less likely he or she is to suffer from depression, a new study suggests. That's especially true for girls, according to researchers from the University of North Texas, who found a link among middle schoolers. The findings, which have yet to appear in a peer-reviewed journal, came after researchers analyzed the fitness levels of 437 sixth-graders. Overall, those with better fitness were less likely to report symptoms of depression when they entered seventh grade, notes Science World Report. It may have to do with \"better self-esteem, healthier weight, or getting more positive reinforcements that go along with being active,\" the lead researcher tells WebMD. However, \"it could be more biological. We know certain proteins and hormones associated with less depression respond to increased exercise.\" Zeroing in on the issue is important, though, because depression at that age can lead to chronic problems later in life. Researchers see it as one more piece of the puzzle for overall mental health in kids and suggest that school fitness programs could be key. (Meanwhile, a study finds depression can take years off your life.)"

Another official said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had traced the origin of the weapon, but the official declined to disclose the circumstances of its purchase. \n \n The United States Park Police had obtained an arrest warrant charging Mr. Ortega-Hernandez with a felony count of carrying a deadly weapon. The agency had also released photographs showing that Mr. Ortega-Hernandez had distinctive tattoos, including the word “Israel” on the left side of his neck. He was also said to have three dots tattooed on his right hand, the name “Ortega” on his back, rosary beads and hands clasped in prayer on his right chest and folded hands on his left chest. \n \n The police in Arlington County took those photographs on Friday when they stopped Mr. Ortega-Hernandez after someone reported that a man outside was circling the area in a suspicious manner. Mr. Ortega-Hernandez was on foot and unarmed, said Lieutenant Joe Kantor, a county police spokesman, and since “there was no crime,” there was no reason to arrest him. \n \n Late on Friday, the police searched the Occupy DC protest camp, on McPherson Square just blocks from the White House, after reports that the suspect might have spent time there.

David Schlosser of the Park Police said any motive would not be clear “until we can talk to this guy.” \n \n He said Mr. Ortega-Hernandez had criminal records in Idaho, Texas and Utah for charges including drugs, underage drinking, domestic violence, resisting arrest and assault on a police officer. Public records indicated much the same thing. \n \n The Secret Service did not have Mr. Ortega-Hernandez on record as someone who had made any threats to the president, an agency official said. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the Secret Service has now found at least two bullets. The agency would not say where the White House had been struck, but workers on Wednesday were examining a window overlooking the Truman Balcony, an area outside the second-floor residential quarters where the first family sometimes relaxes or hosts guests. \n \n A second round was found outside, and officials were searching the South Lawn for any other rounds. The area around the White House was generally more crowded than usual with police cars on Wednesday. \n \n The shooting came from roughly 750 yards south of the White House, just outside the outer security perimeter. The security perimeter extends to the south edge of the Ellipse, a grassy area where the National Christmas Tree is displayed. It is across Constitution Avenue from the more distant Washington Monument. \n \n The street area, usually open to the public, is one of the most guarded parts of the city — or of the country, for that matter — with the United States Park Police patrolling on the National Mall and the District of Columbia police on the streets. In addition, the Secret Service, with a uniformed force of 1,400 officers, has agents on guard at fixed positions on the White House grounds and on patrol nearby in cars and on bicycles. Streets are routinely shut down for motorcades. The Secret Service said its security worked effectively on Friday evening, though it planned to “scrutinize how we can make it better,” an official said. \n \n The Secret Service said it had been tipped off to Mr. Ortega-Hernandez’s whereabouts by a hotel employee who recognized a photograph of him and called the Pittsburgh field office. The field office alerted the Pennsylvania State Police, which dispatched troopers to the hotel. \n \n Investigators established Mr. Ortega-Hernandez’s route by talking to people who knew him, an official at the Secret Service said, and circulated photos of him to several hotels in the area. The investigation involved all of the Secret Service’s 122 field offices in the United States, the official said. \n \n The last known episode in which bullets struck the White House occurred in 1994, when one round fired from the area of the Ellipse penetrated a first-floor window and landed in the State Dining Room, and another was found in a Christmas tree near the South Portico. President Bill Clinton and his wife and daughter were sleeping upstairs. No one was hurt. ||||| This image provided by the U.S. Park Police shows an undated image of Oscar Ortega.

    "summary": "– The 21-year-old drifter suspected of firing a semi-automatic rifle at the White House has been arrested in Pennsylvania, reports the AP. Police say they caught Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez at a hotel in the southwestern part of the state after an intense manhunt. His distinctive tattoos, including a prominent one of \"Israel\" on his neck, didn't help his anonymity. Shots were reported near the White House on Friday, and agents found two bullets yesterday—one stopped by reinforced glass in a window and the other somewhere else on the grounds. Authorities on Friday found an abandoned car with a semiautomatic inside and traced it to Ortega. He reportedly has a history of petty crimes and unstable behavior, reports the New York Times. He had been stopped earlier on Friday by Arlington police after a citizen said he had been suspiciously \"circling the area.\" His family in Idaho reported him missing in late October."

    "document": "It came without warning. \n \n It would start with a howling noise from a senior football player at Sayreville War Memorial High School, and then the locker room lights were abruptly shut off. \n \n \n \n In the darkness, a freshman football player would be pinned to the locker room floor, his arms and feet held down by multiple upperclassmen. Then, the victim would be lifted to his feet while a finger was forced into his rectum. Sometimes, the same finger was then shoved into the freshman player’s mouth. \n \n \n \n This disturbing hazing within the storied Sayreville football program, as told to NJ Advance Media on Wednesday by the parent of a player in the program, happened almost every day in the locker room this fall, he said. \n \n The allegations — revealed for the first time — provide details to the events that sparked a criminal investigation by local and county police, and prompted the cancellation of the remainder of the Sayreville football season this week by Superintendent of Schools Richard Labbe. \n \n The parent, informed by his son and other parents close to the investigation, is the first to come forward to reveal the hazing practices Labbe has characterized as “incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying as constituted by the definition within the anti-bullying statute that took place on a pervasive level, on a wide-scale level, and at a level in which the players knew, tolerated, and in general accepted.” \n \n According to the parent, whose identity is being protected because the parent feared retribution against the family and the player, the routine was initiated when an upperclassman would enter the locker room and make a wolf call or howling noise. \n \n “[For] 10 seconds, the lights would go off and they would grab a freshman and they would go on,” the parent said. “Right on the floor. … It was happening every day. They would get the freshmen.” \n \n He added: “Kids would just sit around and witness [stuff] like this.” \n \n \n \n Detectives from the Middlesex County Prosecutors Office and the Sayreville Police Department are investigating the allegations, but officials have refused to reveal any specifics about the case. The parent said his son and several other Sayreville players have been questioned by police. No charges have been filed. The parent also said he is in the process of retaining an attorney. \n \n \n \n “These parents here, they’re in shock,” the parent said. “We never expected anything like this to happen. Your kid, he’s going to school, school’s got to be a place where you think the kid is the safest.” \n \n When told of the specific allegations over the phone Wednesday, Labbe declined to comment. He referred to his previous comments calling the allegations “very serious.” \n \n The Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office declined comment on the allegations detailed by the Sayreville parent. Also, David Abromaitis, a detective in the office, declined comment Wednesday when reached by phone. \n \n The parent said the “ringleaders” involved in the hazing are seniors. \n \n Madeline Thillet, speaking at Tuesday night’s board of education meeting, said her son was one of the members of the team interviewed by investigators. She downplayed the hazing while protesting the cancellation of the season. \n \n “I was at the police station with him when they were questioning him,” she said. “They were talking about a butt being grabbed. That’s about it. No one was hurt. No one died. I don’t understand why they’re being punished. I think that the forfeited game was punishment enough.” \n \n The parent said he could not “understand how none of the coaches were aware of it. As a coach, you know what’s going on in your clubhouse. You know what’s going on in the locker room.” \n \n \n \n On Oct. 1, Labbe said he was alerted to an anonymous allegation made to Sayreville police about a serious incident of inappropriate conduct —possibly more — by members of the football team. The next day, the matter was turned over to the Middlesex County prosecutor and Labbe canceled Sayreville’s football games — varsity, junior varsity and freshman contests — last weekend against rival South Brunswick. \n \n Then, on Friday, in a separate incident, an attorney for assistant coach Charles Garcia said his client had resigned after details of his arrest for steroids possession surfaced. \n \n \n \n On Monday, Labbe announced he was canceling the rest of the season. \n \n The hazing allegations have turned Sayreville’s no frills, blue-collar community upside-down, as both local and national news vans and media reporters have descended on the town, scouring the streets and interviewing people in parking lots and strip malls. \n \n Many Sayreville residents have expressed outrage over the cancellation of the football season. The varsity team, nicknamed the Bombers, has made the playoffs in each of the past 20 seasons, and Sayreville has captured three state championships over the past four years, feeding nearby Rutgers University with a host of elite players. \n \n Sayreville longtime football coach George Najjar declined comment when reached by phone Wednesday. \n \n More than a hundred Sayreville residents attended Tuesday night’s previously scheduled board of education meeting to urge the members to reconsider the decision to cancel the season. The crowd, at times, grew heated and animated, but the board affirmed the decision to end the football season. \n \n Afterward, about a hundred people gathered under the lights on the football field, lingering for about 15 minutes, gazing across the impressive stadium, until it was time to go home. \n \n Vernal Coleman and Sue Epstein of NJ Advance Media contributed to this report. \n \n \n \n Matthew Stanmyre may be reached at mstanmyre@njadvancemedia.com. \n \n Follow him on Twitter @MattStanmyre.

The decision to cancel the season affects all levels of play -- freshman, junior varsity and varsity, Labbe said. \n \n The Sayreville Police Department and Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office are investigating allegations, and based upon the initial findings, \"there was enough evidence to substantiate there were incidents of harassment, intimidation and bullying that took place on a pervasive level, on a wide-scale level, and at a level in which the players knew, tolerated and in general accepted,\" Labbe said after the meeting. \n \n He added: \"This is a very sad day in Sayreville.\" \n \n Labbe did not identify the victims or alleged perpetrators, and said the school district will determine punishment if charges are filed against the alleged perpetrators. \n \n The announcement is sure to rock the New Jersey high school football community and the storied Sayreville program, which has won three state championships in the past four years. \n \n Parents emerged from the meeting tense and angry, with many speeding away without speaking to reporters. \n \n \"It’s bogus,\" said Curtis Beckham, whose son is on the varsity team. \"They’re holding the kids accountable and not holding the coaching staff and the teachers accountable. I don’t think what they’re doing is fair. A lot of the students who are innocent, they’re suffering.\" \n \n \"I'm outraged that their season is taken away from them and they did nothing wrong,\" added Theresa Tamburri, whose daughter is a freshman cheerleader at Sayreville. \"Let them play. Give them their season back. Give them what they worked hard for.\" \n \n The meeting was called after it was revealed by Labbe last week that \"inappropriate conduct of a significant and serious nature\" had taken place within the Sayreville football program. Several people with knowledge of the allegations told NJ Advance Media the inappropriate conduct was hazing, and one parent said freshmen football players would \"stampede\" to the locker room after practices to get dressed before senior players entered. \n \n Sayreville canceled games across all levels of play this past weekend, and Labbe hinted last week more games could be forfeited. \n \n Unable to calm angry parents at last week's press conference, Labbe called for a private session -- closed to the media -- with parents on Monday night. The parking lots at Sayreville High filled shortly before 7 p.m. with cars decorated with Bombers flags, stickers and pennants. \n \n Men wearing football varsity jackets and state championship T-shirts and holding a Sayreville flag crowded around the back of the school and acted aggressively toward reporters, warning them not to take photographs or attempt to speak to parents after the meeting. The men followed reporters throughout the parking lot, and more than once, one of the men declared, \"Not in our town!\" \n \n Before the hazing allegations surfaced Friday, Charles Garcia, an assistant coach on the varsity team, was arrested and charged with possession of steroids following a traffic stop in Somerset County, police said. Garcia has not commented, but his attorney said the coach had resigned his position. \n \n Sayreville head coach George Najjar also has been silent since news of the arrest and the hazing allegations have come to light. He declined to comment Friday when approached by a reporter. \n \n When asked about the coaching staff and what role they may have played in the bullying, Labbe said he \"cannot comment on personnel matters.” \n \n Tamburri, the mother, said that the cheerleaders and marching band will also not be able to perform the rest of the season. \n \n Her daughter, Jennifer Tamburri, a freshman cheerleader, said the school community is reeling from the news. \n \n \"Everybody was crying when they heard,\" Jennifer Tamburri said. \"It's just terrible seeing everyone so upset.\" \n \n Vernal Coleman and Jeremy Schneider of NJ Advance Media contributed to this report. \n \n Matthew Stanmyre may be reached at mstanmyre@njadvancemedia.com.

    "document": "Getty Images \n \n Ray Rice hasn’t said or done much since he was cut by the Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the NFL last Monday. This Monday, he’ll say plenty. \n \n According to multiple league sources, Rice will appeal the indefinite suspension on Monday. \n \n The appeal will be handled by the NFLPA and by an outside lawyer retained by Rice. \n \n Because the indefinite suspension was imposed under the personal-conduct policy, Commissioner Roger Goodell will have the ultimate authority over the appeal. Don’t be surprised if Rice and the union ask that Goodell designate a hearing officer who has no current connection to the league office, which Goodell ultimately did in the appeal of the players suspended in connection with the Saints bounty case. \n \n Apart from whether Goodell potentially has prejudged the Rice case before the appeal process has played out, Goodell also will be a witness in the appeal process, since one of the key questions is whether Rice lied to the team or the league about what happened in the elevator. \n \n Rice is expected to contend that he told the team and the league the truth. Ultimately, the person who resolves the appeal will have to hear testimony from Rice, Goodell, and other witnesses before deciding whether Rice lied — especially since Ravens G.M. Ozzie Newsome has said that Rice didn’t lie. \n \n In the Saints case, Goodell handed the baton to former Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who ultimately overturned all Saints players suspensions. Whoever handles the appeal, the process creates another vehicle for getting to the truth about what the NFL knew and when the NFL knew it. ||||| Sources say former Ravens running back Ray Rice, along with the NFL Players Association, plan to appeal Rice's indefinite suspension from the league. \n \n Now that former Ravens running back Ray Rice's $35 million contract has been terminated and he's indefinitely suspended by the NFL, the NFL Players Association and Rice are poised to appeal by filing a grievance as soon as Monday, according to sources. \n \n Due process and the precedent for other players facing increased punishment are among the reasons for appealing the increased punishment Rice received, the sources said. \n \n Rice is also considering potential legal action with all options remaining on the table following his increased discipline from the league, according to sources, who noted the potential \"double-jeopardy\" aspect of the former NFL player being punished twice for the same offense. \n \n Sources indicated that Rice is also regarded as likely to hire a crisis management firm to offer him advice. \n \n On Friday, the NFLPA got a letter from commissioner Roger Goodell explaining the increased punishment. The union has three business days to file an appeal, according to the NFL collective bargaining agreement. \n \n \"This video shows a starkly different sequence of events from what you and your representatives stated when we met on June 16, and is important new information that warrants reconsideration of the discipline imposed on you in July,\" Goodell wrote in the letter.\"Based on this new information, I have concluded that the discipline imposed upon you in July was insufficient under all the circumstances and have determined instead to impose an indefinite suspension.\" \n \n Rice was initially suspended two games for violating the NFL personal conduct policy following his felony aggravated assault case. On Monday, a graphic video surfaced of Rice punching his then-fiancee Janay, whom he later married, in a casino elevator in February. \n \n Under Article 46, Section 4 of the collective bargaining agreement governing 'One Penalty,' it states that, \"The Commissioner and a Club will not both discipline a player for the same act or conduct. The Commissioner’s disciplinary action will preclude or supersede disciplinary action by any Club for the same act or conduct.\" \n \n When Rice's contract was terminated, he lost $3.529 million in salary for this season. \n \n There's precedent for players coming back from an ugly off-field incident to play in the NFL again, including former Ravens wide receiver Donte' Stallworth (driving under the influence vehicular manslaughter) and New York Jets quarterback Michael Vick (served time in federal prison for his role in a massive dogfighting ring). \n \n \"It's a tough road to get back in the NFL after an incident like this, but there's a blueprint with what happened with Michael Vick,\" said former NFL agent Joel Corry, who covers the business of football for National Football Post. \"What Ray has to do is work on repairing his image and staying out of any further trouble. If he pursues legal action, there's the question of whether that makes it more difficult for him to get reinstated by the league. \n \n \"Ray has rights to consider under the collective bargaining agreement and as a dues-paying member of the union, so it's going to be interesting to see what he and the union do with this situation.\" \n \n awilson@baltsun.com \n \n twitter.com/RavensInsider",

The NFL players' union, which will reportedly handle the appeal along with Rice's own lawyer, is still working on a plan for the basis of the appeal, sources say. Rice was suspended after video was released showing him allegedly knocking out his then-fiancee in an elevator; an ex-FBI chief is conducting an independent inquiry into the NFL's handling of the case.

Please find his note, posted in its entirety, below. \n \n *********************************************** \n \n To our Zynga Community, \n \n Today is a hard day for Zynga and an emotional one for every employee of our company. We are saying painful goodbyes to about 18% of our Zynga brothers and sisters. The impact of these layoffs will be felt across every group in the company. \n \n None of us ever expected to face a day like today, especially when so much of our culture has been about growth. But I think we all know this is necessary to move forward. The scale that served us so well in building and delivering the leading social gaming service on the Web is now making it hard to successfully lead across mobile and multiplatform, which is where social games are going to be played. \n \n These moves, while hard to face today, represent a proactive commitment to our mission of connecting the world through games. Mobile and touch screens are revolutionizing gaming. Our opportunity is to make mobile gaming truly social by offering people new, fun ways to meet, play and connect. By reducing our cost structure today we will offer our teams the runway they need to take risks and develop these breakthrough new social experiences. \n \n Because we’re making these moves proactively and from a position of financial strength, we can take care of laid off employees. We’re offering generous severance packages that reflect our appreciation for all of their work and we hope this will provide a foundation as they pursue their next professional steps. \n \n Although these are hard decisions, I’m confident that our strategy of building leading franchises and supporting them with the largest network is the right one for the long term. I’m encouraged by our recent progress. Running With Friends is a great example of the quality player experience we can deliver, already receiving an average 4.5 app star rating from 22,700 players in less than one month after launching. Our FarmVille franchise teams continue to innovate and deliver ground breaking new social experiences like County Fair which, despite only being available on the web, is engaging 39 million monthly players. \n \n I want to thank every one of you for the spirit, creativity and energy that you’ve invested in Zynga. You’ve reintroduced a generation of people to gaming and through these games offered them new ways to connect with their families, make new friends and even sometimes find love. \n \n Everyone will be affected by these changes and I’m sure there will be many follow up questions to this email. If you have specific questions relating to your project or team, please talk to your manager. For any other feedback or thoughts feel free to email me directly. \n \n Mark ||||| After Zynga Confirms 18 Percent Layoffs, It Lowers Guidance in All-In Mobile Move \n \n Zynga confirmed it was laying off 18 percent of its workforce — which represents 520 employees — in a bid to reduce costs, as it seeks to drastically restructure its troubled business. \n \n The move today will affect every part of the San Francisco social gaming company, cutting $80 million in staff costs for its 2,900 current workers. It will also include the closing of its offices in New York, Los Angeles and Dallas, as well as other infrastructure costs, adding to the total expense reduction. \n \n Zynga continues to have big offices in San Francisco; Beijing, China; and Bangalore, India, as well as several small units across the U.S. (such as Seattle and San Diego). \n \n Sources said that severance benefits will extend for several months and include some acceleration of stock options. \n \n In addition, Zynga has now said in a press release that it is downgrading its investor guidance for the second quarter with results at the lower end of what Wall Street has been expecting. \n \n After a rocky IPO and trying to cope with rapid changes in its core businesses, Zynga has been trying to refocus the company’s franchises and network on the shift to mobile and a narrowing of focus at the company. \n \n That refocusing will now have a big impact on Zynga’s financial performance. For Q2, the company had previously said its “bookings” — related to sales of in-game virtual-good purchases and advertising — would be in the $180 million to $190 million range. Today, Zynga said results would now be in the lower half of that range. \n \n In addition, its GAAP net loss for the quarter will be higher than expected, rising from a loss of $26.5 million to $36.5 million to a loss of between $28.5 million and $39 million. \n \n All other metrics are expected to remain the same, including: Revenue ($225 million to $235 million); earnings per share (a loss of three to five cents); adjusted EBITDA (break even to a loss of $10 millon); and non-GAAP EPS (a loss of three to four cents). \n \n Wall Street is not reacting well to the bad news. Zynga’s shares have dropped from 11 to 12 percent since AllThingsD.com broke the news of the layoffs. It is now at about $3 a share, giving the company a market valuation of $2.4 billion. Trading for Zynga was briefly halted, before the company confirmed the cost cuts.",
    "summary": "– Hard times have hit Zynga, maker of hit social games like Mafia Wars and FarmVille—as well as numerous other now-closed duds. The company, which was blindsided by the steep rise in mobile gaming and corresponding desktop decline, is laying off 18% of its workforce, around 520 people, All Things Digital reports. The company will also close its offices in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas as part of its cost-cutting drive. \"None of us ever expected to face a day like today, especially when so much of our culture has been about growth,\" founder and CEO Mark Pincus wrote in a note to employees, promising generous severance packages and saying the cost-cutting is a necessary part of developing \"breakthrough new social experiences.\" Zynga's share price dived 12% to $2.99 yesterday, a full 70% below its December 2011 IPO price, the Wall Street Journal reports."

    "document": "Originally published October 16, 2014 at 2:04 PM | Page modified October 17, 2014 at 6:49 PM \n \n Chief operating officer Troy Alstead said the company will increase starting-pay rates in all U.S. markets beginning in January and allow visible tattoos. Starbucks is also creating a contest that offers winners “Starbucks for Life.” \n \n Starbucks kicked off its holiday season with gifts for its employees and new strategies to draw in customers, including the promise, for a lucky few, of free java for life. \n \n The Seattle coffee giant announced Thursday it will pay its U.S. employees more and relax its dress code to allow tattoos and other forms of self-expression to show. \n \n Starbucks also will start letting customers in Portland order using their mobile phones before the end of the year, a service that will spread to the rest of the U.S. through 2015. \n \n It also unveiled a most unusual promotion, designed to enroll customers in its loyalty programs: the chance for a few shoppers paying with a Starbucks Card or a mobile device to win “Starbucks for Life.” Ten winners in the U.S. will receive one free item — from drinks to salads to pastries, but with some restrictions — every day for 30 years. \n \n The moves come as Starbucks seeks to navigate two important challenges: consumers’ migration from malls to online shopping, and growing concern about the quality of retail jobs, especially as these, once considered temporary, are filling the gap left by manufacturing in the American economy. \n \n Starbucks has long offered benefits unusual in the retail sector, such as health insurance, even for part-timers, and stock. Recently it launched a program to subsidize online college education at Arizona State University for its baristas; the first 1,000 or so began classes Oct. 15. \n \n But the company has been criticized over relatively low pay and over inconsistent and hectic work schedules. \n \n Chief Operating Officer Troy Alstead said Thursday in an email to staffers the company will increase starting-pay rates in the U.S. in January. That month all baristas and shift supervisors will also receive a raise, and experienced partners will be eligible for a “lump sum increase” to reward tenure. Pay will be reassessed annually. \n \n The company didn’t disclose pay rates, which vary according to market; a Starbucks employee recently told The Seattle Times he started at $9.50 an hour. Job-reviews website Glassdoor indicates the average barista wage is $9.32 an hour. \n \n These improvements follow moves by the company to allow customers paying with mobile phones to tip baristas using the Starbucks smartphone app. \n \n Retailers have long lagged behind manufacturers in pay because of their slim profits. But Starbucks, which has been growing like gangbusters in recent years, has plenty of money: It made $512 million in the quarter that ended June 29, on $4.1 billion in revenue. \n \n As of the end of its fiscal year, September 2013, the company employed nearly 182,000 people around the world, including 137,000 in the U.S. \n \n CEO Howard Schultz, a longtime proponent of providing good benefits to employees, says investments in staff help everybody: the staffers, the company’s bottom line as it improves retention of better employees, and a society afflicted with a growing pay gap. \n \n “You can’t look at anything today as a zero-sum game,” he said in a recent interview. \n \n Starbucks also loosened its strict sartorial policy to allow baristas more flair. They can show tattoos, except for those on the face and throat; the change addresses a popular complaint by baristas, who complained that having to wear long sleeves to cover tattoos was uncomfortable and outdated. \n \n Barista Kristie Williams started a Coworker.org petition last August to change the tattoo policy. It collected more than 25,000 signatures. “I am jumping up and down and am so excited that we can now be more comfortable at work,” Williams wrote in a statement. \n \n Baristas can also sport colored ties and neck scarves, as well as black denim. Shirts can be worn untucked if the shirt is no longer than the back pockets and “your midsection doesn’t show.” Multiple piercings — formerly a no-no — are now allowed, as long as it’s no more than two earrings per ear and a small nose stud. \n \n The ban on “unnatural (hair) colors” — such as purple, green or pink — continues, however. \n \n “We want to build a company where self-expression, empowerment and inclusion are nurtured,” Alstead said. \n \n Starbucks will also offer employees more time with managers to talk about their personal goals and the work environment. In addition, the company will offer bonuses to 28,000 outstanding employees each quarter, while eliminating performance-review forms and ratings for baristas and shift supervisors. \n \n Store employees will also get one free food item per shift. \n \n The initiatives announced Thursday “will ensure we are paying a competitive wage that better positions us to attract and keep the best partners,” Alstead wrote in his email to staffers. \n \n Ángel González: 206-464-2250 or agonzalez@seattletimes.com.

It did not specify the amount of the increase. The company also expanded its annual review and merit raise program to workers who had hit the top of their pay ranges. \n \n Starbucks will also allow workers one free pastry or other pre-made food item per shift. \n \n Related: Starbucks to pay for 1,000 workers to go to college \n \n Starting Oct. 20, the dress code, previously one of the more conservative ones in the coffee industry, will now permit untucked shirts, nose studs, shorts, skirts, black jeans, tan khakis and colorful scarves and ties. \n \n Before the announcement, baristas had to keep their black-and-white uniforms tucked in and cover up any tattoos. \n \n At the same time, the company dialed back some dress code freedoms. Baristas and supervisors will no longer be allowed to wear watches, bracelets or rings with stones (such as wedding rings). \n \n While many workers praised the eased restrictions around clothes and body art, a vocal contingent decried the new watch and ring restrictions on a company-run Facebook (FB, Tech30) page for employees. ||||| Starbucks Corp. Chief Executive Howard Schultz is trying to reverse the “seismic shift” he noticed last year when Americans in large numbers turned to online ordering for holiday gifts, leaving brick-and-mortar retailers suffering. \n \n After the winter holidays last year, Starbucks reported lower-than-expected same-store sales growth, citing a drop in traffic at malls and shopping centers, which resulted in fewer trips to its cafes. Traditional retailers saw only about half the holiday traffic in 2013 as they did three years...",
    "summary": "– Starbucks is aiming to boost business over the holidays by offering chances to win \"free Starbucks for life\"—although life is defined as 30 years. In the December promotion, 10 people who use Starbucks cards or mobile apps at the chain's stores will win a free coffee or food item—although probably not a $47.30 \"Quadriginoctuple Frap\"—every day for the next 30 years. \"Every time you buy or gift a Starbucks card, embedded in it is an opportunity for 10 people in North America to win Starbucks for life,\" CEO Howard Schultz tells the Wall Street Journal. He says he came up with the idea after being \"asked for many years by other CEOs and celebrities\" whether it was possible to give someone the gift of Starbucks for life. Starbucks has also got some treats for its workers: Baristas and supervisors are getting an undisclosed pay raise, as well as one free food item per shift, reports the Seattle Times. The company has also loosened its dress code, dropping its ban on visible tattoos, as long as they're not on the face or throat, and allowing things like nose studs, shorts, colorful ties, and untucked shirts, CNN reports. But under what Starbucks says are \"food safety rules,\" watches and bracelets are now banned, as well as rings with stones, including wedding rings."

    "document": "The southern peak was first measured in 1880, when it stood at 2,123 meters. Its height has varied from year to year, growing in colder years and shrinking in warmer ones. But since 1995, it has shrunk almost a meter a year, with few exceptions, the newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported. \n \n Located in far northern Sweden, Kebnekaise is a popular tourist destination. Last year, about 10,000 people reached the summit of the southern peak, a trip that usually takes 10 to 15 hours. But once the northern peak officially becomes the highest mountain, that could change as climbers seek to summit the new highest peak. \n \n “It could have that effect, yes,” said Stefan Kallstrom, head of the Swedish Mountain Rescue Service. “From a safety aspect, the north peak is much harder to climb than the south. It has a different topography.” \n \n Anders Bergwall, an Arctic guide and alpine rescue worker who covers the Kebnekaise area, also said he expected more people to set their sights on the north summit. \n \n “I think everybody wants to go to the highest point, of course,” he said of the south peak. “It’s super beautiful, but they will want to go another 700 meters to go to the highest point.” \n \n There has been a dramatic increase in visitors to Kebnekaise in recent years, he said, adding, “It’s popular even among people without a mountaineering background.” \n \n The trek to the north peak is more dangerous. It requires climbing to the southern tip, then a harrowing, 700-meter journey “along a cold and steep snow and ice ridge,” Mr. Bergwall said. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Linda Givetash \n \n LONDON — Sweden's tallest peak is on course to lose that title as a persistent heat wave melts away inches of the glacier atop it daily. \n \n The height of Kebnekaise mountain dropped by 13 feet during July, according to the latest measurements. \n \n Weekly temperatures in parts of northern Europe could reach as much as 18 degrees above normal levels through early August, according to forecasters — with hot conditions also contributing to wildfires raging north of the Arctic Circle. \n \n Gunhild Ninis Rosqvist, a professor of geography at the University of Sweden, said she was \"surprised\" to find the glacier receding so quickly \"even though it has been ridiculously warm\" this summer. \n \n \"When we got up there, I could see the surface of the glacier looked different than I've ever seen it before,\" she added. \n \n The Kebnekaise mountain range in northern Sweden. Stian Lysberg Solum / AP file \n \n Kebnekaise's south peak was measured at 6,893 feet above sea level on July 2. It was down to 6,879 feet by July 31, meaning an average loss of about 5.5 inches of the glacier daily. \n \n The south peak is now just 7.8 inches taller than the typically much shorter north peak, which has less snow and ice atop it. \n \n Rosqvist said if melting continues at the same pace, the south peak will no longer be Sweden's highest point at some point later this month. \n \n In Kiruna, a town east of Kebnekaise that is located north of the Arctic Circle, temperatures were expected to reach 66 degrees on Thursday, according to the World Meteorological Organisation. That's well above the average August high of 57 degrees. \n \n The mercury isn't expected to cool significantly on the continent any time soon. In central Portugal, temperatures are forecast to reach 125 degrees this weekend — potentially the highest level ever recorded in Europe. \n \n Rosqvist said if climate change means summers like this become the norm, the glacier on Kebnekaise could disappear in 30 years. \n \n The hot temperatures have also contributed to Sweden's worst wildfire season in history, according to the World Meteorological Organisation, with more than 74,000 acres burned. \n \n More than 50 fires broke out in July fueled by \"exceptionally hot\" conditions and precipitation at unusually low levels. The WMO said parts of southern Sweden are experiencing the driest summer on record. \n \n And the Kvikkjokk-Arrenjarka weather station, which sits on the same latitude as northern Alaska, reported a record high of 90.5 degrees last month. \n \n Rosqvist said she hopes the extreme weather serves as wake-up call and a sign that changes are needed to address climate change immediately. \n \n \"The awareness is quite high but it’s somehow difficult to get going to change the way we live,\" she said. \"I'm concerned we're not moving forward more rapidly.\"",
    "summary": "– Sweden's (former) highest peak has been taken down a few notches, thanks to the summer heat wave currently scorching Europe. Until recently, a glacier perched atop the southern peak of the Kebnekaise mountain rose higher than any other point in the country. But, as of Wednesday, it had melted so much that it now falls a hair below the height of the mountain's northern peak, the New York Times reports. Gunhild Ninis Rosqvist, a geography professor at Stockholm University, says she's \"surprised\" by the rapid melt-off (about 13 feet during July), per NBC News, \"even though it has been ridiculously warm.\" Once towering 6,892.4 feet, the southern peak was down to 6,879.2 feet as of Friday, per Business Insider. The northern peak measures at 6,879.3 feet. Rosqvist, speaking to a local Swedish paper, says the melting glacier is symbolic of climate change, per the Times. When first measured in 1880, the southern peak was more than 6,965 feet tall. Since 1995, it has shrunk about 3 feet per year. Still, the southern tip is expected to gain back a bit of lost height during the winter, and the title of highest point may vacillate between the southern and northern peaks in years to come. One consequence of the melting southern peak is that climbers may now opt to tackle the northern peak so they can say they climbed to the highest point in Sweden, a rescue worker tells the Times. And, he says, that peak is \"much harder to climb\" due to the topography. Record heat has also affected Sweden's reindeer herders, causing a lack of vegetation and snow melt that makes it so \"not even the reindeer can find a place to get relief from the sun,\" Rosqvist says."

    "document": "Long-term stress may reduce a woman’s ability to conceive by as much as 29 percent, a new study from the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center finds. \n \n From 2005 to 2009, researchers followed 401 reproductively healthy couples who were trying to get pregnant. Over a period of 12 months, researchers recorded each couple’s time-to-pregnancy and observed that by five to six months into the study, the couples who had yet to conceive were those with the highest levels of chronic stress. \n \n “When we get to couples starting to have problems [conceiving], stress levels really seem to differ from those who get pregnant [quickly],” lead study author Courtney Lynch, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center told FoxNews.com \n \n To study stress levels, Lynch and her team collected saliva samples from the women at the beginning of the study and after the women’s first menstrual cycles. For each woman, they recorded levels of the biomarker salivary alpha-amylase, which measures the body’s sympathetic adrenomedullary pathway, more commonly known as the “fight or flight” system. Unlike cortisol, a biomarker that measures acute stress, salivary alpha-amylase levels indicate chronic stress levels. \n \n “[People] think of ‘fight or flight’ as an acute response, but as time has gone on, folks have realized if you’re experiencing chronic stress, lots and lots of acute stress, that ‘fight or flight’ [response] never turns off,” Lynch said. \n \n Researchers found that women with the highest levels of salivary alpha-amylase had a 29 percent reduction in their ability to conceive and more than two-fold greater risk of infertility, compared to women with the lowest levels. \n \n The study, published in the journal Human Reproduction, is the first to observe an association with infertility and salivary stress biomarkers. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 6.7 million women have difficulty getting pregnant, representing 10.9 percent of women of reproductive age. \n \n Their findings suggest that stress-reducing methods may be beneficial for some couples trying to start a family. Typically, a couple trying to conceive won’t meet with an infertility specialist until after 12 months of trying, at which point the specialist will start by recommending lifestyle interventions such as quitting smoking, cutting back on caffeine intake and starting stress-reduction techniques. Lynch believes focusing on stress earlier may be beneficial. \n \n “Stress is not an issue until you’ve tried to get pregnant for a while and not succeeded…if you’ve tried for six months the key thing to recommend would be to take a look at your stress level and think about taking up some sort of stress-reduction activity such as yoga, exercising more, mindfulness or meditation,” Lynch said. \n \n While it’s unknown which stress-reducing modality is best for improving fertility, Lynch said they’re all helpful in improving overall health. \n \n As for how exactly stress affects fertility, the study negated two commonly believed mechanisms—that couples who were more stressed had less intercourse and that stress may delay ovulation. Among participants, women with high levels of salivary alpha-amylase were having as much intercourse as those with lower levels. Researchers used fertility monitors to track ovulation and found no delayed ovulation among women with high levels of salivary alpha-amylase. \n \n “We don’t have an answer at this point,” Lynch said. \n \n While stress alone is not the only contributing factor to infertility, Lynch emphasized that it is a factor that couples can control, in order to improve the chances of getting pregnant. \n \n “Stress is not helping you. Whatever you can do to lower that…not only can potentially help you get pregnant faster, but if you start your pregnancy healthier, you’ll be a healthier pregnant woman, a healthier post-partum mother,” Lynch said. “[Lowering stress] ensures people have as healthy and as productive a life as they’re able to have.” ||||| Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter \n \n / Updated By Linda Carroll \n \n Women trying to get pregnant are often told, \"Relax and it'll happen.\" It turns out that the common advice may actually have some merit, according to a new study that suggests stress is linked to fertility problems. \n \n Women who had high levels of a biomarker for stress in their saliva took 29 percent longer to become pregnant, compared to those with lower levels, a study published Monday in the journal Human Reproduction found. And those with high levels of the stress indicator were also twice as likely as others to meet the clinical definition for infertility — having unprotected sex for 12 months without becoming pregnant —by the end of the study. \n \n It's a common tale: Women get pregnant while on vacation, or women with infertility problems become pregnant after adopting, said the study’s lead author, Courtney Lynch, director of reproductive epidemiology at The Ohio State's Wexner Medical Center. That’s not always a coincidence, she said. \n \n The new study focused on 401 women ages 18 to 40 who had just decided to try to conceive. The women, who had no known fertility problems at the start of the study, were followed for 12 months, or until they became pregnant. \n \n \n \n Saliva samples were collected from the women at the beginning of the study and analyzed for two stress biomarkers: cortisol and alpha-amylase, a digestive protein found in saliva. While levels of cortisol — the hormone most usually associated with stress — didn’t seem to be important, levels of alpha-amylase seemed to predict which women would have the easiest time getting pregnant. \n \n In the big fertility picture, however, stress “is a minor issue,” compared to other factors that can affect it, such as blocked tubes, ovarian problems, smoking or age, Lynch said. \n \n The point of the new research isn't aimed at blaming the victim, she added. One-third to one-half of fertility issues are related to male factors. “Reducing stress won’t help if your husband has a low sperm count,\" she said. \n \n There is no current easy test to see who is is vulnerable to stressors, Lynch said, noting that's a next step in the research. \n \n \n \n Infertility specialist Dr. Suleena Kansal Kalra, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania Health System, says the new research is interesting, but infertility is a complex problem. \n \n “Women who are doing everything they can to get pregnant often are told by well-meaning people, ‘If you would just relax you would get pregnant.’ That can be very counterproductive.” \n \n Still, women can try to control certain stress factors, perhaps even as soon as they decide they want to become pregnant, said Lynch. A solution can be as simple as making time to exercise 20 minutes to 30 minutes per day. \n \n Abby David, 39, started trying to conceive a decade ago. At the time, she was teaching children with developmental disabilities from 7:30 a.m. until 6 p.m. each day and also trying to start a new school for children with autism. After a year of trying, David started therapy to stimulate her ovaries, to no avail. Only after her school finally opened, did she conceive — with triplets. \n \n If she’d known the link between stress and infertility, she might have scaled back, she said. \n \n “When you don’t know if you’ll ever have kids, you’re willing to do whatever it takes,” David said. \n \n Some studies show complementary therapies such as acupuncture can help with stress and infertility, said Dr. Joseph Sanfilippo, vice chairman of reproductive sciences at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. \n \n The bottom line, Sanfilippo said, is there is a delicate balance in the system that controls a woman’s reproductive cycles. \n \n “The hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is the orchestra leader,” he explained. “It’s finely tuned. And stressors can affect it. Diet and exercise can help control stress. Beyond that, I say, look at the menstrual cycle if you are under a lot of stress. If it’s pretty regular, theoretically stress shouldn’t be affecting ovulation.” ||||| Stress may make it harder for women to become pregnant, a new study suggests. \n \n Stress may affect some women's chances of becoming pregnant, a new study suggests. \n \n Researchers found that women who had higher levels of an enzyme in their saliva called alpha-amylase, an indicator of stress, took longer to conceive. The study is the first to show a link between infertility in women and stress levels measured in saliva. \n \n \"We showed that women who had the highest levels of alpha-amylase were more than twice as likely to not become pregnant after 12 months as women who had the lowest amounts,\" said study author Courtney Lynch, a reproductive epidemiologist at The Ohio State University College of Medicine. \n \n The findings also suggest that the effects of stress seemed to show up after couples had been trying for five months to become pregnant. The researchers found that women's odds of becoming pregnant at the outset were fairly similar regardless of their alpha-amylase levels, but after five months, women with the highest levels of alpha-amylase began to have lower odds of becoming pregnant. \n \n \"The study's key finding is an apparent association between preconception stress and the probability of getting pregnant,\" Lynch told Live Science. \n \n The study is published online today (March 24) in the journal Human Reproduction. \n \n Stress and infertility \n \n To explore the role stress may play in women's ability to conceive, the researchers looked at 501 couples in the United States. These couples had no prior history of infertility and had been trying to have a baby for no more than two months. \n \n To evaluate stress, the researchers measured the women's levels of alpha-amylase and cortisol, another saliva-based biological marker of stress, and both men and women kept a daily journal of their perceived stress levels. [Blossoming Body: 8 Odd Changes That Happen During Pregnancy] \n \n The women gave two saliva samples during the 12-month study. One sample was taken the morning after the women enrolled in the project, before they ate, drank, smoked or brushed their teeth — habits known to influence alpha-amylase production. A second sample was collected the morning after the women had their first menstrual period during the study. \n \n Of the 401 couples who completed the study, 347 of them became pregnant. \n \n The results revealed that women who had the highest levels of alpha-amylase were 29 percent less likely to become pregnant than women with the lowest levels. But the data showed no relationship between a woman's cortisol levels and her chances of conceiving. \n \n Although cortisol and alpha-amylase are both indicators of stress, they work in two different biological pathways, Lynch said. Levels of cortisol are more representative of chronic stress, so differences in cortisol levels may not have turned up because saliva tests were done only during the early months of the study, she said. \n \n Managing stress \n \n The role that stress may play in infertility, and the mechanism by which it may influence a woman's chances of having a baby, are complicated. \n \n It's been suggested that couples who are struggling to become pregnant feel more stressed and have sex less frequently. But the new research found no evidence that couples who were unable to conceive had sex less often than couples who were able to conceive. \n \n \"This study indicates that if a couple has not gotten pregnant after five to six months of trying, it may be stress-related,\" Lynch said. \n \n She encouraged women who are trying to conceive to look into stress-reduction techniques. Those relaxation methods may include mindfulness meditation, yoga, regular physical activity or breathing exercises. \n \n Lynch said researchers don't yet know which relaxation approaches may work best in improving the chances of conceiving. She also pointed out that high stress levels are neither the only nor the most important factor in predicting a woman's ability to become pregnant. \n \n \"We have no hard evidence that stress-management techniques may be helpful, but it wouldn't hurt for women to give one of them a try,\" Lynch said. \n \n Follow us @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

Overall, the 12-month study, which involved 401 US couples that had no history of infertility and had just started trying for a baby, found that the women with higher levels took 29% longer to conceive than the women with lower levels, Today reports. Interestingly, however, alpha-amylase levels didn't make a difference at first—couples had similar odds of getting pregnant when they first started trying, but after five months, the women with the highest levels saw their odds decrease. \"This study indicates that if a couple has not gotten pregnant after five to six months of trying, it may be stress-related,\" says the study author. Why? It's not clear, but the study found no evidence that the stressed women were having less sex or that stress delays ovulation, Fox News reports. The study author's advice to women who are trying to have a baby: Try meditation, yoga, regular exercise, or breathing exercises to reduce stress."

    "document": "Ancient humans found with red hair weren't necessarily redheads in life, but may have acquired their carrot tops after death, a new study finds. \n \n A team of researchers examined the processes that degrade locks, ranging from exposure to the sun's powerful rays or being eaten away by microbes. These processes, many of which begin while a person or animal is still alive, can leave hair with an unnatural, reddish hue. \n \n The findings are not only important for archaeology, but also for conservation efforts and forensic investigations, according to the study published Oct. 21 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. [5 Health Risks of Being a Redhead] \n \n Silvana Tridico is a forensic scientist at Curtin University in Perth, Australia, and co-author of the study. She's been studying hair for the past 30 years. \"There aren't too many people who do it at the level I do it at,\" Tridico said. \n \n In the study, Tridico and her colleagues examined about 450 hairs from a variety of animals, including ancient humans, modern humans and woolly mammoths. The researchers first examined the hairs under a microscope at low magnification, recording the locks' color, length and physical profile. Using a scanning electron microscope, the scientists examined a fraction of the hairs in much greater detail, revealing the strands' surface contours. \n \n They found that many of the processes that degrade hair occur not only after death, but also in living animals. Microbes, especially fungus, appear responsible for much of the degradation, but sunlight and other factors also play roles. \n \n Hair today, gone tomorrow \n \n Hair contains two kinds of pigments, one that produces dark hair and one for red hair. The sun degrades these pigments in a process known as photo-oxidation, but the hair pigment for darker hair isn't as stable as the one for red hair, so hair turns a reddish color when exposed to sunlight for long periods of time. This is why the hair of ancient aboriginal people in Australia has a reddish tint, Tridico said. \n \n The researchers also found that fungi had invaded many of the hairs they studied. Some of the hairs were \"just covered by fungus,\" Tridico said. When a layer of tiny fungal filaments called hyphae coats a hair, it can give the strand a reddish color, she said. And since fungi need heat and moisture to grow, finding them reveals something about the environment in which an animal lived. \n \n Sometimes, hair can pick up red pigmentation from its environment. Iron from soil or permafrost can seep into hairs, staining them red, Tridico said. For example, some of the \"bog people\" who have been found preserved in peat marshes in Northern Europe have reddish hair. But the bogs contain a lot of tannins, the bitter substance in tea or wine, which can degrade the pigments in hair, Tridico said. While she hasn't examined the hairs from the bog people herself, she said, \"I strongly suspect tannins have infiltrated them and given them a reddish tinge.\" \n \n Like human hair, animal fur can redden after death, too. Some scientists say that woolly mammoth fur was a strawberry-blond color. But \"that garish orange color can't possibly be natural,\" Tridico said. Instead, the animals probably had a layer of colorless hair that soaked up iron from the permafrost, she said. \n \n The only process of hair degradation that occurs exclusively after death is a darkening of hair roots known as postmortem banding. Because this only happens in certain conditions, it can be useful in forensic science, helping investigators reconstruct the events and environment at the time of death or burial, the researchers said. \n \n The findings show that hair can reveal a lot about a person in both life and death. \"I want to raise awareness of hair,\" Tridico said. \"I think it's really misunderstood and undervalued.\" \n \n Follow Tanya Lewis on Twitter and Google+.

From a forensic perspective, the only certain indicators of death in hair are signs called post mortem banding. \"If you are going for a rescue, in a missing persons case, and you find that post mortem banding, you know 100 per cent that it is going to be a recovery,\" she said. The paper says keratinolytic fungi has been found on the living even though it was previously associated with hair only after death. Once that could have led to someone being wrongly suspected of moving a body after it had been buried. It can still tell other stories though. \"Keratinolytic fungi can tell you this person died probably when it was very warm and moist, because fungi don't grow where there is no oxygen and where it is dead dry.\" The researchers dismiss the myth that ancient peoples and animals were often red-haired. They might have been, but it could also be the decaying process.",
    "summary": "– If hair at a crime scene shows signs of a \"fungal invasion,\" forensic scientists may well conclude the hair's owner is dead—but that's not the case, a new study in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B explains. Conventional wisdom has held that the fungi only invade the hair of the deceased, but the truth is less precise, researchers found: The presence just indicates the person had contact with soil, perhaps at a playground or stable, says forensic biologist and lead study author Silvana Tridico. \"In reality, the missing person might still be alive, albeit with an infection of fungus. But that doesn't mean hair is useless in investigations. \"DNA is fantastic, but hairs tell you a story,\" Tridico tells AAP. In fact, if investigators really want to know if a person is dead, they should check for what's called post-mortem banding, in which bacteria mark a hair's root; it's the only hair modification process that \"unequivocally takes place after death,\" the researchers determined. The study, which the authors describe as \"the first to describe holistically the factors responsible for the biodegradation of mammalian hairs,\" involved an examination of 95 hair samples from various mammals, including woolly mammoths and humans. Another hair myth, per the study: that earlier eras were full of redheads. Hair exposed to sunlight or environmental pigments (like iron or tannins) can over time take on a reddish hue. In the case of wooly mammoths, \"that garish orange color can't possibly be natural,\" Tridico tells LiveScience. She suspects iron from the permafrost colored their hair."

Elizabeth Weise, reporting from San Francisco Superior Court, explains what happened. Chris Wiggins for USA TODAY \n \n Ellen Pao, who is suing venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, hugs her lawyer, Therese Lawless, after closing arguments in the case ended March 25, 2015. (Photo: Vicki Behringer) \n \n SAN FRANCISCO — A jury ruled against Ellen Pao on Friday in her sex discrimination case against venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. \n \n The jury found Kleiner Perkins did not discriminate against Pao on the basis of gender, did not keep her from a promotion because of her gender, took reasonable steps to prevent gender discrimination at the firm and did not retaliate against her for complaining about gender discrimination. \n \n As the courtroom convened to hear the verdict around 2 p.m. local time today, Silicon Valley was literally on pins and needles in anticipation of who would win the closely watched case that highlighted a gender gap in the industry. Pao, after all, was taking on the venerable venture-capital firm behind Google, Amazon.com, Genentech and scores of others. \n \n And it was Kleiner Perkins that won on all counts. \n \n \"Today's verdict reaffirms that Ellen Pao's claims have no legal merit. We are grateful to the jury for its careful examination of the facts,\" Kleiner Perkins said in a statement. \n \n \"There is no question gender diversity in the workplace is an important issue,\" the VC firm said. \"KPCB remains committed to supporting women in venture capital and technology both inside our firm and within our industry.\" \n \n As the jury forewoman read out the \"no\" of the first part of the verdict, Pao's lawyer, Therese Lawless, reached over and squeezed her shoulder. As the list of \"no's\" continued, there were a few muted gasps in the room. \n \n Next came a hiccup on the question of whether or not Pao was retaliated against because she wrote a memo about what she believed was gender discrimination at the firm or because she eventually filed a lawsuit against the firm. \n \n The jury forewoman initially told Judge Harold Kahn the jury had found Pao was not retaliated against for speaking up about discrimination at the firm. \n \n Kahn then polled the jury to get each juror's vote on the record. When he did, the vote on the fourth claim of retaliation was eight for no, she was not retaliated against, and four for yes, she was. In civil court, a three-quarters vote, which would be at least nine for no, is required. \n \n The judge told the jury members to return to their deliberations. About two hours later, the jury returned with a 9-3 verdict against Pao on the retaliation claim. \n \n One juror changed his mind between the original decision being made in the jury room and walking into the courtroom, juror Steve Sammut said during a quickly-organized news conference afterwards. \n \n To his mind, the most compelling support for Kleiner came when the jury looked at annual reviews for several partners that were introduced into the testimony. \n \n The \"areas to improve\" tended to stay the same for Pao, he said. Other staffers, both male and female, who were later promoted to senior partner tended to have areas of poor performance drop off and new ones come up, he said. \n \n Juror Marshalette Ramsey had the opposite reaction.To her, the performance reviews showed clear sexism. \n \n The same kinds of personality traits might be cited in the reviews, but depending on how it was worded and whether the person was male or female, \"it could either propel you to promotion or termination,\" she said. \n \n However she was adamant that the jury was not divided between men and women. \"I was the only woman\" on Pao's side, she said. \n \n She was not bitter about the outcome. \"I think Ellen Pao has opened all our eyes,\" to problems of sexism in the workplace, she said. \n \n PAO'S SUIT WAS CLOSELY WATCHED \n \n Pao's suit asked for $16 million in lost wages and future earnings, as well as a possible $144 million in punitive damages. \n \n Pao joined Kleiner in 2005 as chief of staff to John Doerr, a highly-regarded general partner at the firm. She began to transition into a role as junior investing partner beginning in 2010. \n \n She was fired on Oct. 1, 2012. She says that was because she had complained about gender discrimination, though Kleiner said it was because she didn't have what it took to become a senior investment partner. \n \n In her suit, Pao accused the powerful firm of not promoting her to senior partner because she was a woman and retaliating against her after she began talking with senior staff about what she said were problems with sex discrimination beginning in December 2011. \n \n Kleiner's stance was that Pao was part of a general \"up or out\" system at the firm, where many junior partners worked at the firm over the years but few were promoted to senior partner. \n \n Even though Pao lost, the trial was a win for women, said Joan Williams, an expert on gender law and professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco. \n \n \"There's no turning back,\" she said. \"This case will have an impact on how venture capital and tech in general run their organizations, regardless.\" \n \n It's remarkable the case even came to public trial, said Noreen Farrell, executive director for Equal Rights Advocates, a non-profit women's rights organization based in San Francisco. Few women stand up to this kind of discrimination in the venture capital industry because of \"this fear of retaliation and the wrath of these really rich companies,\" she said. \n \n \"This case has already blown the lid off what's happening at this intersection of tech and finance in a very public way,\" she said. \n \n After the verdict was read, Pao thanked her family, friends and legal team for their support. \n \n \"I want to thank the people all over the world who reached out to me with their stories. My story is their story,\" she said. \n \n \"If I've helped to level the playing field for women and minorities in venture capital, then the battle was worth it. Now,\" she said, \"it's time for me to get back to my career.\" \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1bCYLAZ",
    "summary": "– Jurors in a high-profile Silicon Valley case say a prestigious venture capital firm did not discriminate against a female employee. The jury in San Francisco reached a verdict today on three of four counts in the lawsuit filed by Ellen Pao against Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Confusion surrounded the fourth count, one alleging that the company fired Pao in retaliation for her lawsuit, reports the Wall Street Journal. A court clerk initially announced that the company had been cleared, but when the judge polled the jury, he found the result was 8-4, not 9-3 as thought. Nine votes are necessary for a decision, and the judge sent the jurors back for more deliberations. If they can't get a ninth vote, that count could end in a hung jury, reports USA Today. The case has shined a spotlight on the technology and venture capital sectors, where women are grossly underrepresented. Industry consultants said the case had sparked some companies to re-examine their cultures and practices for potential gender bias. Jurors heard conflicting portraits of Pao during closing arguments. Her attorneys said she was an accomplished junior partner who was passed over for a promotion and fired because the firm used different standards to judge men and women. A lawyer for Kleiner Perkins countered that Pao failed as an investor at the company and sued to get a big payout as she was being shown the door."

That is the message that we need to send abroad,\" Venizelos said as he announced the deal in a televised statement. \n \n The most critical issue for the new government is the formation of a national task force to renegotiate the terms of Greece's unpopular international bailout, he said. \n \n Greece will go to a two-day summit in Brussels later this month determined to push fellow European leaders on the issue, he added. \n \n Venizelos said it is unfortunate that the anti-austerity party Syriza, which placed second in the election, had declined to join the other parties in seeking the best way forward for the country. \n \n New Democracy, which broadly favors Greece meeting international debt obligations, led the talks on forming a coalition after narrowly taking first place in Sunday's election. The socialist Pasok party placed third. \n \n Dr. Vassilis Monastiriotis of the Hellenic Observatory at the London School of Economics, said it is a positive step that Greece now has a government, but few details about key appointments or policies are yet known. \n \n The Cabinet will be dominated by ministers from New Democracy, after its partners said they would support the government but did not want to be part of it, he said. However, it may include a couple of technocrats from Pasok and a representative from the Democratic Left. \n \n Venizelos's focus on the negotiating team that will seek to amend the terms of Greece's bailout deal, rather than the Cabinet, may signal his desire to be part of that team, Monastiriotis noted. \n \n An early test for the new government will be the Brussels summit on June 28-29, when it will seek to present a strong front to European leaders as it puts forward proposals on changing the terms of the loan agreement and new investment for growth, he said. \n \n While few specifics are known, all three parties are keen to renegotiate a provision under which Greece's current minimum wage of 750 euros a month (about $950) would be cut by 22%, Monastiriotis said. \n \n But, he said: \"There's no decision about how (they) actually deal with the immediate problems of acute poverty in parts of society and problems of tax collection.\" \n \n He predicted that the international community will show patience with the new Greek government at least until September, not least because any alternative would be far more radical and anti-European. \n \n And while Samaras has in the past been rather narrow in his views, Monastiriotis said, the politician has shown some leadership in recent days in making concessions to form the coalition. \n \n Kouvelis announced Wednesday morning that his party's central committee would back the coalition government but that it wanted efforts made to ease the burden of austerity on the Greek people. \n \n \"This support is connected to the political platform that will be decided. The Democratic Left is insisting that this platform will contain commitments that will ensure the removal of measures that have gravely affected the Greek society. The country must have a government, but for us the substance of this government's policy is the big challenge,\" Kouvelis said. \n \n The leftist party has supported bailouts from international lenders while seeking to renegotiate the terms. \n \n With almost all ballots counted, New Democracy had won nearly 30% of the vote, the Interior Ministry said, giving the party 129 seats in the country's 300-seat Parliament. \n \n Syriza, which campaigned against the terms of the bailout, got 71 seats. \n \n Pasok, which long dominated Greek politics, won 33. Four smaller parties took fewer than two dozen seats each. \n \n Alexis Tsipras, the fiery leader of the leftist Syriza party, met with Samaras but said Monday he would not back a coalition. \n \n \"History and the people will judge them by their results,\" Tsipras said of the parties backing some kind of bailout deal with the creditors who are keeping Greece afloat. \"Shortly we will be vindicated.\" \n \n He said his party's nearly 27% showing had forced Greek leaders to realize the bailout is \"nonviable,\" and said Syriza would press as a member of the opposition for the bailout to be scrapped in its entirety. \n \n The vote was widely seen as a referendum on whether Greece should remain tied to the euro, the currency used by 325 million people across 17 countries in Europe. The possibility of a \"no\" vote roiled world markets, with some analysts warning that the collapse of the euro would cost $1 trillion. \n \n International bailouts have kept Greece from defaulting in the face of an ongoing recession and low tax revenue, but lenders have demanded hugely unpopular government budget cuts in exchange. \n \n Some observers had predicted that efforts to renegotiate the bailout could lead to a run on Greek banks and deeper misery. \n \n The country must identify additional budget cuts by the end of June to be considered compliant with the terms of its bailout. After five years of recession, unemployment is running at about 22%, taxes are going up and many of those with jobs are suffering cuts to wages. \n \n German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Europe's powerful advocate for balancing budgets to build a strong basis for economic growth, had urged Greeks not to walk away from the international loan deals. \n \n \"We will stick to the agreements. That is the basis on which Europe will prosper,\" she said Saturday. ||||| Greece has a government, the head of the country's socialist party said Wednesday, ending nearly seven weeks of political uncertainty which threatened to plunge Europe deeper into a financial crisis with global repercussions. \n \n In this Tuesday, June 19, 2012 photo a tourist takes photos of the ancient Roman agora, near the octagonal ancient tower the horologion of Andronicos (Tower of the Winds), left, in central Athens, Greece....

If you always thought the men who run U.S. military intelligence are wack jobs, here's the farce to prove it.

Django conducts dance classes to let his hippie-warrior monks loosen up (the wigs alone on Bridges and Clooney make the scene a hoot). The mind-meld approach to vanquishing your enemies by these so-called Jedi (loved the deadpan on Obi-wan McGregor's face when the holy name is mentioned) pisses off group infiltrator Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey spitting sarcasm in high-comic style).

It would be cheaper than a pilotless drone, for one thing, though not necessarily smarter. Those who wish to pursue this exciting possibility are advised to see “The Men Who Stare at Goats,” which is based on a book by the British journalist Jon Ronson. What Ronson discovered, in his researches, was a section of the United States military that was solely and specifically tasked with mental combat. “More of this is true than you would believe,” an opening title declares. What a tease. \n \n Our Ronson-like protagonist is an American reporter named Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor). He works in Ann Arbor, but craves a wider beat; the craving takes him to Iraq, or, at any rate, to a Kuwaiti hotel. There he meets Lyn Cassidy (George Clooney), who claims to be one of the Jedi Warriors, men who stared at goats until they—the goats, that is, not the men—fell down dead. (“What’s a Jedi warrior?” Wilton asks. So that’s why McGregor was hired: for the sake of an in-joke.) Staring was just one of the indispensable skills that were drilled into Cassidy and his comrades, years before, by Bill Django (Jeff Bridges), who vowed, “We must become the first superpower to develop super powers.” Django was a ponytailed visionary—if that’s not a tautology—who, following an epiphany in Vietnam, founded the New Earth Army, in order to establish whether love and peace can win wars. The answer is “They can’t,” but that didn’t stop his recruits from trying to run through walls, or the government from sponsoring the program. \n \n Most of these training sessions are viewed in flashback. The film’s director, Grant Heslov, flips constantly between the Django regime and the recent situation in Iraq, as Cassidy—who says he has been reactivated—crosses the border, with Wilton in tow, on a mission too secret to be revealed. If Heslov and his screenwriter, Peter Straughan, prefer to linger on the early days of the unit, it’s because that is where the action is, or was. Hence the quick, perfect scene in which an ambitious psychic named Hooper (Kevin Spacey) congratulates the happy couple at a wedding reception, and adds, “Sorry it doesn’t work out between you two.” \n \n At moments like this, the movie feels rich in satisfactions. To watch actors as nimble as Bridges, Clooney, and Spacey clashing wits as if they were lightsabers is precisely the kind of fun—grownup fun, delivered by men, not kids, and lit not by special effects but by a serious love of the joust—that I demand from Hollywood and, for the most part, no longer get. Each man vies to be the most deadpan, determined to present his character, a solemn clairvoyant fruitcake, as nuttier than the rest. Clooney is probably the winner here, even turning to McGregor and wielding the famous “sparkly eyes” technique, as taught to super-spies, without a smirk. The most handsome and capable star in the world, and he doesn’t mind coming across as a total dork. It’s not fair. \n \n It’s also not fair that the movie lets him down. Clooney gives it everything, but what does he get in return? A void where the story is meant to be. For a while, everything ambles along like a mashup of “Three Kings,” the 1999 Clooney film about the first Gulf War, and the Three Stooges, with Heslov dishing out roof tumbles, car smashes, and cheek slaps. Much of this is neatly framed—an eye poke, for some reason, is funnier in long shot—and you sit there for an hour, in good humor, waiting for the narrative to stop noodling around and get going, only to realize, to your consternation, that it’s winding down. In truth, there just isn’t enough motion here to sustain a motion picture. The material is a gift: Considering the mileage that Robin Williams got out of “military intelligence” for his radio riffs in “Good Morning, Vietnam,” you can imagine the glee with which he would have feasted on the news of psychic soldiering. As for Joseph Heller, it’s only the thought that some targets are just too pitifully easy that might have restrained his hand. In both cases, however, the Jedis would surely have supplied no more than a telling subplot, or a skit. After all, it’s not as if they ever achieved anything. \n \n Late in the day, efforts are made to knock up a makeshift finale. In a covert facility in the desert, Wilton and Cassidy, the logic of whose actions is roughly half of that allotted to Hope and Crosby in “Road to Morocco,” stumble upon Django and other figures from the past. We get a communal acid trip—always a clear sign of a movie with nowhere to go—followed by pounding volleys of rock music, as a herd of goats, which have been shot at rather than merely stared at, are set free, together with a cluster of orange-suited enemy prisoners, who have been tortured. This sideways glance at a deeply uncomical and still potent issue is one hell of a misstep on Heslov’s part. Having urged us to take nothing seriously throughout, how can he expect us to switch, for a couple of minutes, to a thoughtful and disapproving frown? What is this, “Road to Guantánamo”? Safely back in America, Wilton pledges to “tell everybody what happened.” But that’s the problem, Bob. Nothing did. \n \n Please make sure, when you buy a ticket for “Precious: Based on the Novel ‘Push’ by Sapphire,” to pronounce the title in full. I know you will. There was a plan to call it “Push,” until another movie got there first. But why not call the new one “Precious,” and leave it at that? After all, Deborah Kerr didn’t star in “The Innocents: Based on the Novella ‘The Turn of the Screw’ by Henry James,” and Dustin Hoffman didn’t star in “Rain Man: Based on the Overwhelming Desire to Win an Academy Award by Dustin Hoffman,” so why the change in rubric?",

It’s been hard for me to adjust.” \n \n Her compulsion, now removed from her life, has been to appear on stage eight times a week for three months in David Mamet’s play Speed-the-Plow at the Playhouse theatre, a run that had come to an end a week before we met. Contrary to expectations, she didn’t miss a show (or a cue) and is finding withdrawal tough. She is still talking to the director Lindsay Posner every day, planning her next fix: she is desperate to do another Mamet play with Posner – Oleanna – as early as possible in the new year. \n \n Lohan, 28, has been acting on screen since her parents (of whom it was once observed “if they were any more low-rent they’d be a spring-break destination”) put her forward for auditions when she was three. The London show is only the second time she has appeared on stage, however – the other was a school production of Cinderella at 13 when, having been cast as an ugly sister rather than the lead (and already a real-life million-dollar-a-movie Disney princess) she walked out after a couple of performances. One of several great things about her latest commitment, she says, is that for three months it removed a question that has dogged her recent life: how to fill the evenings? \n \n “In LA I didn’t know what to do apart from go out every night,” she says. “That’s when my friends were free. And I would go out and there would be all these cameras there and that’s when it became difficult.” That obsessively documented “difficulty” is shorthand for the literal multiple-car-crash-of-a-life that saw Lohan twice imprisoned for driving under the influence, indicted for fights in nightclubs and for lying to the police, in and out of rehab for drug and alcohol addictions and on almost permanent probation for the last seven years: the ubiquitous cautionary caricature of celeb excess gone bad. At one point in 2011 Lohan was ordered to do a series of 12-hour shifts of community work in the LA county morgue. If the intention of that curious punishment was to give her a sense of her own fragile mortality, the talent she was throwing away, it has taken until this year to finally sink in. \n \n She herself puts her current sobriety down to a couple of things. Firstly, the intervention and example of the archetypal celebrity fairy godmother, Oprah Winfrey. In the curious double bind of Oprah’s friendship, the counselling sessions she gave Lohan were broadcast to a global TV audience and an intrusive five-part reality show about Lohan’s struggles with life lived in public was aired in the spring. Lohan remains grateful for the last of many “second chances” Oprah offered her. The second strand of her strategy to change her life around was perhaps braver and more radical, however: she moved to London. \n \n Lohan has lived in the capital for nine months now, has a lease for another year on her flat in the West End, and is currently planning to make it her permanent home. She can’t emphasise enough the liberation the move has given her. “I can go for a run here on my own,” she says. “I do every morning, early, and I think how my friends in New York would still be up partying at that time. I needed to grow up and London is a better place for me to do that than anywhere else.” \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Lindsay Lohan (Karen) and Nigel Lindsay (Charlie Fox) in Speed-The-Plow at the Playhouse theatre in London. Photograph: Tristram Kenton \n \n The defining moment of this shift, she says, came on a holiday she took to Greece in the summer. “It was,” she says, still thrilled at the idea, “the first time I have ever just been on a vacation by myself. I just wandered about on my own! I turned off my phone. It was so extraordinarily freeing for me. Like another life.” The world, which had for so long reflected back to her an ugly image of herself, was suddenly just “out there”. \n \n “I won’t live in LA again, hell no,” she says. “My friends tell me shit when they come over I don’t want to hear. I don’t even know who got married and who got pregnant. You turn on the news in LA and it is all gossip about people. All the stuff that is going on in the world right now and this gossip is the news?” She laughs. “I love the BBC. I haven’t heard myself mentioned on TV since I have been here. That has been really weird for me, and great.” \n \n Having moved to London, there was, she says, quickly only one thought in her head: to do a play. She was encouraged to take on the role of Karen in Mamet’s Hollywood satire not only by the playwright himself but also by his friend, Al Pacino. The actor came to see Lohan a couple of nights into her performance and offered her advice throughout the play’s run. \n \n “He said I know you are going to love this, it will be such a rush for you. He helped me get a routine; I like to meditate a bit before I go on to stage. He warned me the adrenaline you have after is tricky, it’s late and you want to do something. I have let myself go eat, and then I have gone home.” \n \n The other thing she has learned was that all-important lesson of having to turn up. Having infamously stood up the American justice system on several occasions, she was determined to prove herself able to keep an appointment. “One time I was sick with a bug, I had been vomiting all day, but no way was I going to miss a show. I was sitting there beforehand seeing spots in front of my eyes. I had a plan: if I felt sick on stage I was going to faint, play dead, pretend it was part of the script. Didn’t happen fortunately.” \n \n The self-imposed disciplines made her feel good about herself for the first time since she can remember, since the early successes of The Parent Trap and Freaky Friday, maybe. “Going on to a film set there have been times when I really hated it,” she says. “When I just wanted to stop and be home. I should have done that, because instead all the court stuff happened.” \n \n Lohan’s redemptive Hollywood journey from jail to stage would not be complete, of course, without a degree of 12-step wisdom. Oprah gave her a self-help book that has become her bible, The Untethered Soul, by Michael Singer. The book has helped her to shut down the destructive voice in her head, she says, the one that, against her first instincts, told her to get in the car drunk, or turn up late for the court appearance, or to have just one more. “There is a chapter called ‘The Rose and the Thorn’, you sit on a couch, and you imagine that voice in your head as a person next to you. You learn how to distance yourself from that person.” \n \n Part of her “intention-led” life has been to become involved in a charitable community project in London, the Red Route Cafe in Hackney, which helps young people find a sense of purpose through volunteering. “The kids there know me a bit now,” she says, “and they treat me the same as everyone else. That is so cool for me. In the past I got used to meeting people who would seem like genuine people but often they would have other intentions. There is less of that for me here now.” \n \n She hasn’t given up on movies, but the immediacy of the stage is something she will not give up lightly. Will we be seeing Lohan doing Shakespeare any time soon? “I would like to do a period piece at least,” she says. “I enjoyed having a British accent when I did Parent Trap so I guess I am halfway there. The way I see it,” she says, a threat and a promise, “the longer I live here the less of a choice you will all have not to hire me for plays… ”",

    "document": "Carl Vinson strike group seen near Indonesia, not the Korean peninsula \n \n YOKOSUKA NAVAL BASE, Japan — If the USS Carl Vinson strike group is heading to the Korean peninsula, it is taking its time. \n \n More than a week after reports first emerged that the aircraft carrier and its accompanying ships were headed toward the peninsula amid fears North Korea may conduct another nuclear test, Navy photos from Saturday show Vinson operating nearly 3,500 miles away, off Indonesia. \n \n Defense News first reported the existence of the photos, which are freely available on the official Navy.mil website. \n \n If traveling at maximum speed, which the Navy lists at “34.5+ mph,” it would take the carrier, two destroyers and a cruiser roughly four to five days to reach the peninsula from Indonesia’s Sunda Strait. \n \n Submarines also regularly provide undersea cover for carrier strike groups. \n \n U.S. Pacific Command officials in Hawaii on Monday referred questions about the strike group to Pacific Fleet, which said it does not discuss details of ship movements. \n \n “The Carl Vinson Strike Group cancelled a previously planned port visit to Australia and is continuing on track for all assigned missions in the Western Pacific,” a statement said. \n \n Thus far, reports on Vinson’s impending arrival in waters near South Korea have come from White House and other Washington officials. The Navy and Pacific Command haven’t dissuaded any of those reports, but never explicitly confirmed Korea as its destination or discussed a timeline. \n \n PACOM directed the Vinson strike group “to sail north and report on station in the Western Pacific Ocean after departing Singapore on April 8 … rather than executing previously planned port visits to Australia,” according to its initial statement on the move. \n \n Soon afterward, PACOM spokesman Cmdr. Dave Benham said the strike group was ordered north “as a prudent measure to maintain readiness and presence. \n \n “Third Fleet ships operate forward with a purpose: to safeguard U.S. interests in the Western Pacific.,” Benham said. The number one threat in the region continues to be North Korea, due to its reckless, irresponsible, and destabilizing program of missile tests and pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability.” \n \n In an interview with President Donald Trump on Fox Business News last week, host Maria Bartiromo asked, “You redirected Navy ships to go toward the Korean Peninsula. What are we doing right now in terms of North Korea? \n \n “You never know do you? You never know,” Trump responded. \n \n After declining to discuss military movements initially, Trump then said that, “We are sending an armada. Very powerful.” \n \n “We have submarines. Very powerful; far more powerful than the aircraft carrier, that I can tell you,” he added. \n \n A Reuters reporter covering the Pentagon first reported April 9 that the Vinson strike group was headed toward the Korean peninsula, citing an unnamed U.S. official. \n \n “We feel the increased presence is necessary,” the official told Reuters, citing North Korea’s worrisome behavior. \n \n The Vinson group includes the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and its embarked air wing, the destroyers USS Wayne E. Meyer and USS Michael Murphy, and the cruiser USS Lake Champlain. \n \n Trump has stated that all options, including military action, are possible as North Korea continues to develop its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons program. The communist state has conducted two nuclear tests and test-fired nearly 30 missiles since last year. \n \n A North Korean missile exploded seconds after launch Sunday, according to U.S. officials. The failure came as Vice President Mike Pence arrived in the South for talks. \n \n Stars and Stripes reporter Wyatt Olson contributed to this report. \n \n slavin.erik@stripes.com \n \n Twitter:@eslavin_stripes ||||| (CNN) The aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and its strike group will arrive off the Korean Peninsula at the end of April, multiple US defense officials tell CNN. \n \n The carrier and its escorts left Singapore on April 8, according to a statement from the Navy's Pacific Fleet. They were ordered to head north to the Korean Peninsula in response to North Korean provocations, defense officials told CNN at the time. \n \n JUST WATCHED US warships sent to Korea: What to know Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH US warships sent to Korea: What to know 01:32 \n \n Officials later said the strike group, including the 97,000-ton carrier and its 60-plus aircraft, the guided-missile destroyers USS Wayne E. Meyer and USS Michael Murphy and the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain would participate in naval exercises with the Australian navy south of Singapore before heading to Korea. \n \n But the announcement that the Vinson had been dispatched to Korea increased tensions with Pyongyang, with its official Korean Central News Agency calling the carrier's deployment \"nothing but a reckless action of aggression to aggravate the tensions in the region.\" \n \n US President Donald Trump added to the tension early last week by telling Fox Business News he was sending \"an armada\" of powerful warships and submarines to waters off Korea. \n \n Read More ||||| WASHINGTON — For more than a week, media reports in the U.S. and around Asia routinely have mentioned the approach of the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson's carrier strike group, seemingly implying an attack on North Korea could be imminent. But a week after the U.S. announced the carrier and its escorts would leave Singapore, forego port calls in Australia and instead return to Korean waters, the carrier and its group had yet to head north. \n \n \n \n Rather, the ships were actually operating several hundred miles south of Singapore, taking part in scheduled exercises with Australian forces in the Indian Ocean. \n \n \n \n On Saturday — according to photographs released by the U.S. Navy — the carrier passed north through the Sunda Strait, the passage between the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java. It's about 3,500 miles from Korea. \n \n \n \n U.S. Navy officials in Pearl Harbor and Washington declined to comment on the ship's movements, other than to confirm the April 15 movement through the Sunda Strait. Off the record, several officials expressed wonderment at the persistent reports that the Vinson was already nearing Korea. \"We've made no such statement,\" said one official. \n \n \n \n Those same officials did not push back on reports that the Vinson would return to Korean waters, where the strike group operated for much of March as part of the annual U.S.-Korean Foal Eagle exercises. While declining to confirm a specific date, they did not dispute speculative media reports from South Korea that the strike group could be in the region by April 25 or so. \n \n \n \n Officials did, however, flatly deny reports that three U.S. carrier strike groups were being directed to mass off the Korean peninsula in a few weeks. \n \n \n \n Speculation has been rising that the Ronald Reagan and Nimitz strike groups could join with the Vinson. The Japan-based carrier Reagan, however, is in a maintenance period at Yokosuka scheduled to complete in May. The Bremerton, Washington-based Nimitz and her strike group is off Southern California, nearing the completion of its major pre-deployment exercise. The ship is scheduled to deploy this spring to relieve the Vinson in the Western Pacific. \n \n \n \n The Vinson's return to Korea was ordered on April 8 by Adm. Harry Harris, commander of U.S. Pacific Command. On April 11, Defense Secretary James Mattis – having just met with Harris in Washington – noted that no specific incident prompted the order to curtail the exercise program and head north. \n \n \n \n \"She's stationed there in the western Pacific for a reason,\" Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon. \"She operates freely up and down the Pacific, and she's just on her way up there because that's where we thought it was most prudent to have her at this time. There's not a specific demand signal or specific reason why we're sending her up there.\" \n \n",
    "summary": "– If the USS Carl Vinson is supposed to be near the Korean peninsula sending an ominous signal to North Korea, nobody informed the USS Carl Vinson. Despite a slew of reports suggesting that the aircraft carrier was in the area, or about to be, a report at Defense News reveals the reality: The Vinson is currently about 3,500 miles away, taking part in military exercises with the Australian navy south of Singapore. That's not to say the carrier won't get to the Korean peninsula, but even if it left now and traveled at its top speed, it would take four to five days, reports Stars and Stripes. Defense officials tell CNN that things won't happen that quickly: They expect the Vinson and its strike group to arrive off the Korean peninsula around the end of the month. Just don't expect an announcement about the destination from the Navy, which doesn't divulge details about the location of its warships. Stars and Stripes notes that reports suggesting the Vinson was high-tailing it toward North Korea have come from officials in Washington, not the Navy, which has said more broadly that the carrier is moving toward the \"Western Pacific Ocean\" and avoided any mention of a timetable. Last week, President Trump spoke of \"sending an armada\" to the region, and reports about the Vinson even caught the attention of North Korea, which called it \"nothing but a reckless action of aggression to aggravate the tensions in the region.\""

And so begins his wonderful take on the state of encryption. \n \n \n \n This 20-minute segment sees Oliver taking on the entire topic of encryption, with an obvious focus on the current San Bernardino case. He treads his typical line of irreverence and insight, neatly summarizing the whole debate along the way. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Perhaps predictably for Oliver, who’s openly supported digital privacy in the past, he sides with Apple. But he provides an informed and balanced take on the subject, admitting that “there’s no easy side to be on in this debate.” It’s well worth watching. \n \n [Last Week Tonight] ||||| Note: Due to the political nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our Politics, Religion, Social Issues forum. All forum members and site visitors are welcome to read and follow the thread, but posting is limited to forum members with at least 100 posts. \n \n Last Week Tonight host John Oliver tackled Apple and the FBI's duel over encryption as the main segment on his show last night. He played out cases for both sides before siding with Apple and creating a comical ad for the Cupertino company in its signature style explaining why encryption is important.Oliver starts the segment by explaining what encryption is, what it protects and how it can be hacked before diving into the debate between Apple and the FBI, which centers around San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook's iPhone. The segment first lays out the case for law enforcement, touching on Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump's proposed Apple boycott , before spending a significant amount of time explaining why creating a backdoor for the government would be a bad idea.The Last Week Tonight host explains that many critics of Apple's stance on encryption don't seem to understand how modern technology works and that Apple creating a key for this one case is a slippery slope, allowing government officials to approach Apple for other cases. Oliver notes that the encryption debate was waged two decades ago with the Clipper Chip, which allowed for encrypted communication with a backdoor for authorities. The project was abandoned after hacker Matt Blaze figured out how to shut down the authorities' backdoor. \"But decades later [authorities] seem to have convinced themselves that it can be done,\" Oliver said.Oliver then takes on Apple critics who say the company can figure it out due to its success at innovation, noting they may feel that way about \"Apple's magic powers\" due to the way the Cupertino company markets it products. He points out that thinking Apple could create a backdoor and then have the ability to police that backdoor is unrealistic, mentioning that the company has had trouble with hackers in the past. Additionally, he says that Apple bending their encryption standards doesn't matter due to the numerous third-party encryption alternatives that exist.The host closes by saying that other countries, like Russia and China, are watching the debate play out, hoping that they, too, would be allowed a similar level of access to devices. Oliver says that the \"legal tenuousness\" of the FBI's argument, the security risks, the impossibility of Apple enforcing backdoor-equipped encryption, the international fallout and the existence of third-party encryption apps is enough to \"sway the most strident opinion.\" Oliver then closes by showing a comical encryption ad the show made for Apple in the style of the company's iPhone 6s ad s.Last Week Tonight's segment comes the week after the feud between Apple and the FBI stepped up a notch, with the FBI accusing Apple of \"deliberately\" raising barriers to prevent law enforcement to access data on Apple devices. Apple lawyer Bruce Sewell called the claim an \"unsupported, unsubstantiated effort to vilify Apple.\" On Friday, President Barack Obama cautioned against taking an \"absolutist\" view on encryption.",
    "summary": "– First John Oliver took on Donald Trump. Now the HBO host is taking on Apple, the government, and encryption, a safeguard he labeled on Sunday's Last Week Tonight as \"the best way to keep people from reading your emails short of making the subject line 'Fwd: Fwd: Fwd: Fwd: Hilarious Joke From Uncle Walter.'\" Oliver dedicated nearly the entire show to examining whether weakening encryption is worth the risks. After summarizing how important encryption actually is to our daily lives—securing our health records, credit card info, and \"dick pics\"—Oliver frames the issue using the San Bernardino shooting as the backdrop, and he comes squarely down (\"perhaps predictably,\" per Gizmodo) on the side of Apple, which is refusing to make an exception for unlocking shooter Syed Farook's phone. \"Think of the government as your dad,\" Oliver says. \"If he asks you to help him with his iPhone, be careful. Because if you do it once, you're going to be doing it 14 times a day.\" But Gizmodo also notes Oliver carries out his analysis with \"irreverence and insight\" and offers an \"informed and balanced take.\" Check out the entire clip—and stick around till the end, when Oliver creates a bogus Apple encryption ad based on its own iPhone promos, per Mac Rumors. (The San Bernardino County DA says Farook's phone may have wielded a \"cyber pathogen\" as a weapon.)"

    "document": "British drug company GlaxoSmithKline says it will stop offering financial support to doctors and other health-care professionals to promote its products. \n \n The change comes months after GSK was hit by an ongoing investigation of alleged bribery by its employees in China and signals a major shift in the way the company operates. \n \n Chief Executive Andrew Witty said in a statement released Tuesday that the changes are meant to bring \"greater clarity and confidence that whenever we talk to a doctor, nurse or other prescriber, it is patients' interests that always come first.\" \n \n GSK says it will no longer pay health-care professionals to speak on its behalf to audiences that can prescribe medicines and will stop providing direct financial support to professionals to attend medical conferences. ||||| Company to roll out new sales force compensation programme, removing individual sales targets \n \n Begins process to end direct payments to healthcare professionals for speaking engagements or attendance at medical conferences by start of 2016 \n \n \n \n Issued: Tuesday 17 December 2013, London UK \n \n GSK today set out plans to evolve the way it sells and markets its products to healthcare professionals to further align the company’s activities with the interests of patients. \n \n During 2014, the company will implement a new compensation system which will apply to all GSK sales employees who work directly with prescribing healthcare professionals. The company also intends to begin a consultative process towards stopping direct payments to healthcare professionals for speaking engagements and for attendance at medical conferences. At the same time, the company will increase its focus on developing its multi-channel capability and alternative approaches to enable it to continue to provide appropriate information about its products and to support medical education for healthcare professionals. \n \n Sir Andrew Witty, CEO of GSK said: “We believe that it is imperative that we continue to actively challenge our business model at every level to ensure we are responding to the needs of patients and meeting the wider expectations of society. Over the past five years, this has seen us take significant steps to increase access to medicines in developing countries and to be more transparent with our clinical trial data. We’ve also made changes to how we work with healthcare professionals. Building on this, today we are outlining a further set of measures to modernise our relationship with healthcare professionals. These are designed to bring greater clarity and confidence that whenever we talk to a doctor, nurse or other prescriber, it is patients’ interests that always come first. We recognise that we have an important role to play in providing doctors with information about our medicines, but this must be done clearly, transparently and without any perception of conflict of interest.” \n \n Global sales force compensation changes \n \n The new compensation programme will have no individual sales targets. Instead, GSK’s sales professionals who work directly with prescribing healthcare professionals will be evaluated and rewarded for their technical knowledge, the quality of the service they deliver to support improved patient care and the overall performance of GSK’s business. The aim is for this new compensation system to be in place in all of the countries GSK operates in by early 2015. \n \n These changes have been informed by a similar programme successfully introduced by GSK in the USA in 2011. The ‘Patient First’ programme bases compensation for sales professionals who work directly with prescribing healthcare professionals on a blend of qualitative measures and the overall performance of their business, rather than the number of prescriptions generated. Experiences in the last two years suggest that this more patient-focused approach has significantly improved both customer interactions and satisfaction rates with GSK’s US pharmaceutical business. \n \n Payments to healthcare professionals \n \n GSK also announced today the start of a two-year process during which it will make a number of changes to how it works with healthcare professionals. \n \n GSK has an important role to play in supporting education for healthcare professionals and in providing accurate information about its medicines to help them make the best treatment decision for their patients, such as sharing new clinical data, details of label changes or safety updates. Recognising this, the company will direct additional focus and investment to: \n \n Strengthen its own dedicated medical and scientific capability to appropriately lead engagement with healthcare professionals \n \n Improve GSK’s multi-channel capability, including use of digital technologies, to ensure appropriate product and disease area information can be provided to healthcare professionals conveniently \n \n Support fair, balanced and objective medical education for healthcare professionals through provision of independent educational grants. \n \n At the same time, the company will move to end the practice of paying healthcare professionals to speak on its behalf, about its products or disease areas, to audiences who can prescribe or influence prescribing. \n \n GSK will also stop providing financial support directly to individual healthcare professionals to attend medical conferences and instead will fund education for healthcare professionals through unsolicited, independent educational grant routes. \n \n The company intends to work through the practical details of these changes with healthcare professionals, medical organisations and patient interest groups to define how they can be implemented effectively and in line with local laws and regulations. This consultation will begin in early 2014, with the aim for the changes to be in place across GSK’s global business by the start of 2016. \n \n GSK will continue to provide appropriate fees for services to healthcare professionals for GSK sponsored clinical research, advisory activities and market research. These activities are essential in providing GSK with insights on specific diseases; identification of symptoms and diagnosis; application of clinical trial data or medication dosage and administration; and how to effectively and appropriately communicate the benefits and risks of its medicines to help meet patient needs. \n \n The company will also continue to invest in community programmes to strengthen healthcare infrastructure, particularly in least developed countries. \n \n The company has committed to disclose the payments it makes to healthcare professionals and already does so in several countries including the USA, Australia, UK, Japan and France in line with locally agreed government or industry association standards. GSK will continue to disclose the payments it makes for clinical research advisory activities and market research in these countries and will also continue to work towards transparency in other countries as industry associations or governments establish specific guidelines for disclosure. \n \n Notes to editors \n \n - The new compensation system will apply to all GSK sales employees who work directly with prescribing healthcare professionals. Implementation of the new system will start in certain countries from January 2014 with the aim for it to be in place in all of the countries GSK operates in by early 2015, subject to local consultation and in accordance with local employment laws. \n \n - These latest moves build on the steps already taken by GSK to increase access to medicines and operate more openly and transparently. GSK topped the Access to Medicines Index for the third consecutive time in 2012, an independent and robust measure of how pharmaceutical companies perform on improving access to medicines in the world’s poorest countries. \n \n - Earlier this year, GSK launched a new online system to enable researchers to access anonymised patient level data from its clinical trials. The company has also signed up to the AllTrials campaign for clinical trial transparency. \n \n GSK – one of the world’s leading research-based pharmaceutical and healthcare companies – is committed to improving the quality of human life by enabling people to do more, feel better and live longer.

The company's pharmaceutical sales reps will also no longer be paid based on how many prescriptions doctors write for Glaxo drugs. The AP calls it \"a major shift\" for the British company, and it's one that basically ends two controversial practices in the industry. The move comes as China investigates Glaxo for allegedly giving illegal payments to doctors and officials in an attempt to boost sales of its products, but the CEO says the decision was not related to that investigation. The new measures \"are designed to bring greater clarity and confidence that whenever we talk to a doctor, nurse, or other prescriber, it is patients’ interests that always come first,\" he says in a statement. \"We recognize that we have an important role to play in providing doctors with information about our medicines, but this must be done clearly, transparently, and without any perception of conflict of interest.\" (Full statement here.) While doctors will no longer be paid to speak on Glaxo's behalf at conferences or meetings, they will still be paid consulting fees for market research. One critic of the longstanding Big Pharma marketing practices says this is a step in the right direction, but notes that Glaxo will continue to hand out \"unsolicited, independent education grants\" to educate doctors about its drugs, which could be a cause for concern."

    "document": "SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email \n \n The NFL Network, ESPN and Bill Simmons’ The Ringer have suspended five on-air commentators and a senior executive after allegations of sexual harassment by a former co-worker. \n \n The former football players, including Hall of Fame running back Marshall Faulk, Heath Evans and Ike Taylor, allegedly groped and made sexually explicit comments to Jami Cantor when they were colleagues at the NFL Network, according to a lawsuit filed against NFL Enterprises by Cantor. \n \n The allegations against the retired players and former NFL Network executive producer Eric Weinberger, who’s now president of sports commentator Bill Simmons’s media group, are part of a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court. An amended complaint filed Monday detailed specific acts of harassment by several individuals who aren’t named as defendants. \n \n Weinberger sent “several nude pictures of himself and sexually explicit texts” and told Cantor she was “put on earth to pleasure me,” according to the complaint. Cantor says he also pressed his crotch against her shoulder and asked her to touch it. \n \n Eric Weinberger Photographer: Michael Buckner/Getty Images for Variety \n \n She said she was also sexually harassed by on-air talent. Faulk would ask Cantor “deeply personal and invasive questions” about her sex life; he also fondled her breasts and groped her behind, according to the complaint. \n \n Heath Evans Photographer: Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images \n \n Inappropriate Photos \n \n Taylor sent Cantor “sexually inappropriate” pictures and a video of him masturbating in the shower, according to the filing. Donovan McNabb, a former analyst, also texted her explicit comments, according to the complaint. \n \n Faulk, Taylor and Evans have been suspended pending the investigation, said Alex Riethmiller, a spokesman for the NFL Network. McNabb now works for ESPN, which said in a statement that neither the former quarterback nor another employee identified in the complaint, Eric Davis, would appear on its networks during an NFL investigation into the allegations. \n \n Weinberger has been suspended from Simmons’s media properties, including The Ringer website, according to a statement. He hung up the phone when reached by a Bloomberg reporter, and Simmons didn’t return emails seeking comment on the allegations. \n \n Joel Segal, who represents Taylor, didn’t immediately return a voicemail seeking comment. Jordan Bazant, who represents Faulk and Evans, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations. Representatives for McNabb didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. \n \n Cantor first filed her case in October, claiming wrongful termination. Laura Horton, a lawyer for Cantor, said by phone, “It’s outrageous conduct and I fully intend to hold the NFL Network responsible.” \n \n While several men across politics, media, entertainment and the technology industry have been fired over allegations of sexual harassment, this is the most sweeping indictment to surface at the intersection of sports and media. \n \n Earlier this year, Fox Sports fired executive Jamie Horowitz after allegations of harassment; former big-league catcher and Toronto Blue Jays analyst Gregg Zaun was let go for inappropriate behavior toward female coworkers; and former NFL quarterback Warren Moon was accused of harassment. None have the star power or name recognition among casual sports fans like Faulk or McNabb. \n \n Marshall Faulk Photographer: Abbie Parr/Getty Images \n \n Live Programming \n \n At the NFL Network, Weinberger helped create and oversee the network’s live programming, and when Simmons praised his professional record when he hired him. “He’s a talented guy with an impeccable reputation, someone who is uniquely equipped to help me build an innovative multimedia company from scratch,” Simmons said in a 2015 statement. \n \n “I know from experience that you’re only as good as the people around you, and Eric is one of the very best,” he said at the time. \n \n Cantor said she complained about the sexual advances from former NFL players to Marc Watts, the league’s talent coordinator but that he did nothing. According to the complaint, he told her, “It’s part of the job when you look the way you do.” Watts didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment. \n \n Cantor said she also raised concerns about other working conditions at the network, including a failure to reimburse her for expenses and a lack of compensation for the hours she worked. She was terminated by her supervisor at the NFL in October 2016, when she was 51, and replaced by a 30-year-old, according to the complaint. \n \n The revelations and suspensions are the latest in a series of challenges to the NFL, which is coping with falling television ratings amid player protests and public rebukes from President Donald Trump.

Jami Cantor, who worked at the network for a decade, described a series of sexually inappropriate encounters with the three, along with several former NFL players and others who have worked for NFL Network, including Donovan McNabb, Warren Sapp and Eric Davis. \n \n \"I think Jami Cantor is a very courageous woman, as all women coming forward in this #metoo movement,\" Laura Horton, Cantor's lawyer, told USA TODAY Sports in a phone interview. \"All these women are courageous. These women have had the courage to step up knowing that, in the past at least, it would be a 'he said, she said' situation until we've had this national conversation.\" \n \n On Tuesday, ESPN announced that it was suspending McNabb and Davis as it investigated the allegations. \n \n MORE: Donovan McNabb, Eric Davis suspended by ESPN as it investigates harassment allegations \n \n More: 'Piece of meat': Trump sexual misconduct accusers appear with Megyn Kelly on 'Today' \n \n More: Trump sex harassment accusers demand Congress investigate as lawmakers resign \n \n More: Suburban N.Y. chefs react to Mario Batali sexual harassment allegations \n \n The allegations came in an amended complaint that is part of a civil lawsuit originally filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by Cantor in October. The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified general and punitive damages, alleges age and sex discrimination, sexual harassment that created a hostile work environment, wrongful termination and defamation. \n \n Horton said while she could only comment about what was contained in Monday's filing, \"more would come out at trial.\" \n \n Bloomberg was the first outlet to report the amended complaint had been filed. \n \n Cantor alleged that Faulk, who has been one of the NFL Network's top analysts for about a decade, greeted her by \"fondling her breasts and groping her behind,\" according to the complaint. Faulk \"became more aggressive,\" including one instance where he allegedly invited Cantor to his hotel room where she witnessed him expose his genitals and made sexually suggestive remarks. \n \n Cantor also claimed Taylor forwarded “sexually inappropriate” pictures of himself, according to the filing. Horton said that she has a copy of a video sent to Cantor that allegedly shows Taylor exposing himself in the shower. \n \n McNabb, who is currently an ESPN employee, made sexually inappropriate comments via text, asking about a specific sex act multiple times. \n \n Evans, according to the complaint, sent Cantor nude photos of himself on at least twice and \"constantly propositioned (Cantor) to have sex with him.\" \n \n ESPN did not immediately respond to a message left by USA TODAY Sports on the allegations made against McNabb. Representatives for Evans, Faulk and Taylor did not immediately reply to requests for comment Tuesday morning. \n \n The amended complaint also alleged a top executive at Bill Simmons’ media group, Eric Weinberger, of inappropriate conduct. Weinberger, who worked at NFL Network as an executive producer before joining Simmons at The Ringer, allegedly \"pressed his crotch against\" Cantor and asked her to \"touch it,\" according to the filing. He also allegedly made several sexually suggestive comments. \n \n A spokesman for The Ringer told USA TODAY Sports in a statement that Weinberger has been placed on leave pending an investigation. \n \n \"These are very serious and disturbing allegations that we were made aware of today,\" the statement reads. \"We are placing Eric on leave indefinitely until we have a better understanding of what transpired during his time at the NFL, and we will conduct our own internal investigation.\" \n \n Cantor was forced to work in the men's restroom during her tenure at NFL Network and alleged Warren Sapp, who was fired after a 2015 arrest for soliciting a prostitute, urinated in front of her. She protested, but Sapp allegedly laughed off the incident. \n \n Per the complaint: \"Sapp also gave sex toys as a Christmas gifts three years in a row, showed (Cantor) nude pictures of numerous women he claimed to have slept with, and openly talked about his sex life in front of (Cantor) and other NFL employees, including supervisors.\" \n \n Cantor said she complained to Marc Watts, who worked as NFL Network's talent coordinator, about the unwanted sexual advances and comments \"numerous times\" and he \"did nothing.\" \n \n “It’s part of the job when you look the way you do,\" Watts allegedly told Cantor. \n \n Davis allegedly told Cantor, “You look like a woman who knows what to do in bed.\" \n \n \"Mr. Davis also asked Plaintiff to have rough sex with him, and said that he wanted to choke Plaintiff from behind until Plaintiff begged him to stop,\" the complaint alleges. \n \n Cantor's employment ended last year when she was accused of stealing clothes from an unspecified on-air talent member. She denies any theft and, in the filing, said security video would have vindicated her. Cantor was 51 at the time she was dismissed and claims she was replaced by a 30-year-old. \n \n Cantor has \"seen the NFL 'age-out' other older employees,\" according to the filing. \n \n Contributing: Tom Schad",

And so he has decided to let his father, 78-year-old Arthur Brooks, of Beverly Hills, California, proceed with interviewing women who meet the specifications for a suitable mate. According to the ad, the interviews will take place Saturday at The Coeur d’Alene Resort. \n \n “And then I’ll have words with my father separately,” said Brooks, the owner of two health food stores. “Who knows, it can’t hurt. Who the hell knows? \n \n “What am I supposed to do? He already did it,” he added. “No sense in defusing a bomb once it’s already gone off.” \n \n Arthur Brooks, who breeds and races thoroughbred horses, said Monday he wouldn’t answer any questions about his ad until noon Sunday, presumably after he selects a winning prospect for his son. \n \n Reached while on a trip to California, Baron Brooks described his father as “nuts,” “neurotic,” “passive-aggressive” and without boundaries, comparing him to Larry David’s character in the TV series “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” \n \n “That’s my dad: stumbles into stuff, has a loud mouth, thinks he does the right thing, and then it all blows up in his face.” \n \n Brooks also said his father has been ill and really wants a grandson to carry on the family name. \n \n “Ever since he went into congestive heart failure he’s done some really kooky stuff,” he said. “And this one takes the cake.” \n \n Asked why his father would buy an ad in a small daily newspaper in Idaho, Brooks said his dad recently vacationed in Coeur d’Alene and may have been drawn to the area’s conservative politics. \n \n “He knew I’m a political conservative, OK?” said Brooks, who also is Jewish. “And most Jewish girls are quite liberal, and that doesn’t work for me. You probably are going to get more like a Midwest-type values in Idaho – somebody’s who more right of center than you would, say, in Los Angeles.” \n \n The ad noted that Brooks is “looking for a wife who is ready, willing and able to have children as soon as possible,” and also that “you would be a stay at home mom.” \n \n In the interview, Brooks said, “Dating in Salt Lake has been tough because all of the women I meet already have children. … I’ve never been able to meet a woman young enough to have children. But that’s my problem, not his.” \n \n He added that he’s seeing “two different ladies right now, but nobody that I’d probably marry.” \n \n Brooks said he spoke only briefly with his father since learning about the ad, and that his dad told him he also wouldn’t talk with him again until Sunday. In the ad, Arthur Brooks promised to provide the person or persons he selects – and any chaperones – with round-trip airfare and first-class lodgings to meet his son. \n \n “He just does this crap. … If I shared some of the stories, you wouldn’t believe it,” Baron Brooks said. “He just does weird stuff, and nobody knows why.” \n \n He said he never would buy such an ad himself, but added that it’s “pretty well written” from a marketing standpoint. \n \n “It’s worth a shot,” Brooks said. “Can’t hurt.”",

The ad listed a litany of requirements for any prospective wives: 34 to 38 years old, attractive, \"ready, willing, and able\" to have kids ASAP, prepared to be a stay-at-home mom, willing to relocate, and more.

A powerful flare erupted from the bright area in the top-center of the solar disk. \n \n A powerful solar storm nearly heated the Cold War up catastrophically a half century ago, a new study suggests. \n \n The U.S. Air Force began preparing for war on May 23, 1967, thinking that the Soviet Union had jammed a set of American surveillance radars. But military space-weather forecasters intervened in time, telling top officials that a powerful sun eruption was to blame, according to the study. \n \n \"Had it not been for the fact that we had invested very early on in solar and geomagnetic storm observations and forecasting, the impact [of the storm] likely would have been much greater,\" Delores Knipp, a space physicist at the University of Colorado Boulder and the study's lead author, said in a statement. \"This was a lesson learned in how important it is to be prepared.\" [The Sun's Wrath: Worst Solar Storms in History] \n \n The storm began brewing on May 18, 1967, when researchers noticed a big group of sunspots with strong magnetic fields clumped on one part of the solar disk. \n \n Sunspots — dark, relatively cool areas on the sun's surface — serve as launching pads for powerful bursts of high-energy radiation known as solar flares, as well as eruptions of solar plasma called coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which almost always accompany strong flares. \n \n Intense flares that hit Earth can disrupt radio transmissions and satellite communications, among other effects. Earth-directed CMEs can be even more damaging; big ones can spawn \"geomagnetic storms\" that blow out transformers in power grids, for example. \n \n On May 23, 1967, the sun fired off a flare so powerful that it was visible to the naked eye, and began emitting radio waves at a level that had never been seen before, study team members said. \n \n Notes on the region of the sun where the May 1967 solar flare occurred, from May 18, 20, 21, 23, and 28. Credit: National Solar Observatory historical archive \n \n That same day, all three of the Air Force's Ballistic Missile Early Warning System radar sites in the far Northern Hemisphere — which were located in Alaska, Greenland and the United Kingdom — appeared to be jammed. \n \n Air Force officials initially assumed that the Soviet Union was responsible. Such radar jamming is considered an act of war, so commanders quickly began preparing nuclear-weapon-equipped aircraft for launch. (These newly scrambled aircraft would have been \"additional forces,\" according to the study authors; the U.S. kept nuke-bearing \"alert\" planes aloft pretty much continuously throughout the 1960s.) \n \n \"This is a grave situation,\" Knipp said. \"But here's where the story turns: Things were going horribly wrong, and then something goes commendably right.\" \n \n Those additional forces never launched. So what happened? Solar forecasters at the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) — a joint U.S.-Canadian effort that looks out for incoming missiles and other possible threats — and elsewhere figured out that the flare, not the Soviets, had disrupted the radars. (The U.S. military had begun keeping tabs on solar activity, and its effects on Earth, in the 1950s; by 1967, NORAD was getting daily updates on the subject, study team members said.) \n \n Knipp and her colleagues think this information made it in time to Air Force commanders and other high-ranking officials — including, perhaps, President Lyndon Johnson. \n \n \"Oftentimes, the way things work is, something catastrophic happens, and then we say, 'We should do something so it doesn't happen again,'\" Morris Cohen, an electrical engineer and radio scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, said in the same statement. \"But in this case, there was just enough preparation done just in time to avert a disastrous result,\" added Cohen, who was not involved in the new study. \n \n Many of us take the sun for granted, giving it little thought until it scorches our skin or gets in our eyes.

(CMEs travel through space at millions of miles per hour — fast, but not nearly as fast as solar-flare radiation, which, of course, moves at the speed of light.) \n \n The CME triggered a powerful geomagnetic storm, which disrupted American radio communications for nearly a week, study team members said. This storm also ramped up the northern lights, making them visible as far south as New Mexico. \n \n \"As a magnetospheric disturbance, the 25-26 May event ranks near the top in the record books,\" Knipp and her colleagues wrote in the new study, which has been accepted for publication in the journal Space Weather. \n \n You can read the abstract of the paper for free here. \n \n The top spot in the record books, incidentally, likely belongs to the famous Carrington Event of September 1859.

With the radars out of action, Pentagon planners were operating \"in the blind,\" unable to know if enemy missiles could be be heading toward a first strike. \n \n With long-range nuclear-armed bombers already in the air on normal \"alert\" patrols, additional bombers were put on \"ready to launch\" status as options were debated, researchers reported Tuesday. At the height of the Cold War, an attack on early warning radars was considered an act of war. \n \n Luckily, well before President Lyndon Johnson might have been forced to make any irrevocable decisions, a small contingent of \"space weather\" forecasters working for the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, was able to convince the chain of command that a powerful solar storm, not the Soviet Union, was jamming the radars. \n \n American Geophysical Union/National Solar Observatory \n \n It wasn't quite the \"nick-of time\" intervention one might expect at the end of a thriller. But it was an uncomfortable reminder of the high stakes involved, the increasing reliance on high technology and communications problems, or crosstalk, that can combine to trigger an unintended -- and potentially disastrous -- consequence \n \n Delores Knipp, a space physicist at the University of Colorado at Boulder and author of a paper accepted by the journal Space Weather that describes the incident, told CBS News that Air Force space weather officers with NORAD were trying to convince the chain of command that the solar storm was causing the problem even while the Strategic Air Command was placing additional aircraft on \"ready to launch\" status. \n \n \"The information from NORAD and SAC apparently was crossing at the Pentagon before it went to the president,\" Knipp said. \"The president had to approve anything that was going to involve really drastic actions. I frankly don't know if he had to approve launch of additional aircraft or not. \n \n \"So therein lies that little bit of uncertainty in terms of were we on the verge or were cooler heads prevailing all along? And that is not something that I or maybe even my co-authors had privy to. What we do know is that the aircraft did not launch.\" \n \n Five days earlier, on May 18, 1967, a large group of sunspots with intense magnetic fields rotated into view and observers with the Air Force's Air Weather Service predicted a major solar storm. \n \n On May 23, observers noted a major visible light flare and a solar observatory in Massachusetts detected and reported unprecedented radio emissions. A bulletin from NORAD predicted a major geomagnetic storm. \n \n \"There were a series of three bursts from the sun,\" Knipp said. \"The second one started to bring down or severely degrade the kind of communications SAC (Strategic Air Command) would use communicating with its aircraft. \n \n \"So things were already kind of edgy,\" she said. \"Then the third burst, which looked smaller in some wavelengths, actually became an unprecedented large event in terms of a radio burst. And it was the third event that really started the degradation of the BMEWS.\" \n \n Retired Colonel Arnold Snyder, a solar forecaster at NORAD's Solar Forecast Center who was on duty that day, remembers that another weather officer told him the NORAD command post wanted to know if any significant solar activity was occurring. \n \n \"I specifically recall responding with excitement, 'Yes, half the sun has blown away,' and then related the event details in a calmer, more quantitative way,\" Snyder told the American Geophysical Union. \n \n Knipp agreed, saying the sun was \"unbelievably busy that day.\" \n \n So why was there ever any doubt about what was causing the radar problems? \n \n \"It's hard to put ourselves back 50 years and realize they were operating with the barest essential information,\" Knipp said. Along with two radars that could be used to indicate the effects of solar activity, \"they had phone lines and the teletype. And that was it.\" \n \n While the space weather forecasters were studying data coming into the NORAD solar forecasting unit, \"at the same time there was stuff coming downhill, so to speak, from operators at NORAD saying 'my heavens, what is going on here?'\" Knipp said. \"All of that information had to be integrated. And it was pretty basic information. It's not what we have today with spacecraft eyes on the sun 24/7.\" \n \n In the aftermath of the incident, the Air Force greatly expanded space weather forecasting and observations to better understand the sun's behavior and its effects on sensitive electronic systems. \n \n \"AWS (Air Weather Service) notified NORAD in real-time of the event and the associated mission impacts,\" according to the paper submitted to Space Weather. \"However, outside agencies were not aware of the space environmental factors and made uninformed decisions without considering the drastic impacts the event imparted to NORAD's early warning systems, which have a direct bearing on decisions being made at the highest levels of the US government. \n \n \"As a result of this near-incident, the need to incorporate real-time space weather information into the Air Force decision-making process was made obvious to many, and several major efforts were undertaken to greatly improve the operational capability of the AWS Space Environmental Support System.\" \n \n And it wasn't just the U.S. and its allies that made changes. Russia was paying attention, too. Knipp said a Russian colleague now working for the National Solar Observatory told her that the Soviet Union sharply increased funding for solar observatories and research in the aftermath of the 1967 solar storm.",

Knipp tells Space it's fortunate the US \"invested very early on in solar and geomagnetic storm observations.\" The 1967 solar storm was one of the biggest of the last century. The solar flare was visible to the naked eye, and the coronal mass ejection that followed affected radio communications for days and made the northern lights visible as far south as New Mexico.

According to Conrad Lee and Pádraig Cunningham of the Ireland-based Clique Research Cluster, if you want to know what’ll be on playlists around the country in a few weeks, you might tune in to what they’re listening to now in Atlanta. \n \n In “The Geographic Flow of Music,” a paper submitted to the online scientific forum Physics arXiv, Lee and Cunningham analyzed about 60 billion pieces of data from last.fm, a music streaming website. Last.fm publishes lists of the most listened-to artists by geographical location, which allowed Lee and Cunningham to chart how those lists changed across 200 cities since 2003. The researchers used statistical techniques to track which cities served as the trend leaders for listening habits. \n \n (MORE: Next Step for Tupac’s Hologram: National Tour?) \n \n The results? In North America, Atlanta was the leader in predicting overall music trends as well as hip-hop trends, while Montreal was the clear indie music frontrunner. (Sorry, Brooklyn.)

However, the results seem to contradict the assumed notions of musical centers. As The Physics arXiv Blog on the Technology Review points out: \n \n It’s easy to imagine that the biggest cities ought to be those furthest ahead of the curve because they have biggest populations from which new and interesting bands can emerge. That doesn’t seem to be the case in this data–big cities such as New York, LA and London do not lead. “We find only weak support for this hypothesis,” say Lee and Cunningham. \n \n Another unusual phenomenon: cities of similar listening habits — say Birmingham and Manchester in Britain, or Portland and San Francisco in the U.S. — were not linked in the network. Lee and Cunningham proposed that when two cities’ listening habits are synchronized, little is to be gained from following trends out of a sister city, so residents look elsewhere for new music. \n \n (MORE: Of Montreal’s Paralytic Stalks) \n \n Unfortunately, the study’s hit-predicting power hasn’t yet been proven: so far Lee and Cunningham have only used their statistical techniques to chart historical changes. “We have not yet demonstrated that our models have this predictive power, although we plan to attempt this validation in future work,” the researchers say.

But new research adds to the evidence that coffee can have significant health benefits -- far beyond helping you make it to that morning meeting. \n \n The latest study finds coffee may lower the risk for the most serious type of skin cancer, malignant melanoma. Prior research has shown coffee may help prevent other types of non-melanoma skin cancers. However, this is the first large-scale study to look specifically at malignant melanoma, which is the fifth most common cancer in the U.S. and the leading cause of skin cancer deaths. \n \n For the study, published Tuesday in JNCI: Journal of the National Cancer Institute, researchers analyzed data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study on more than 447,000 non-Hispanic whites, who are at higher risk of skin cancer. Study subjects filled out questionnaires about their eating habits, including coffee drinking, and were followed-up after about 10 years. \n \n CDC: Cost of treating skin cancer is soaring \n \n The researchers found that frequent coffee drinkers -- those who consumed four cups or more per day -- had a 20 percent lower risk for developing malignant melanoma than those who drank less coffee. The researchers also observed the protective benefits of coffee increased the more a person drank. Decaffeinated coffee did not provide the same protective benefits. \n \n The authors adjusted for other factors that might influence skin cancer rates, including ultraviolet radiation exposure, body mass index, age, gender, physical activity, alcohol consumption and smoking history. \n \n While the results of this new study are encouraging for coffee drinkers, the authors say their findings are preliminary, and may not be applicable to other populations. \"Because of its high disease burden, lifestyle modifications with even modest protective effects may have a meaningful impact on melanoma morbidity,\" the researchers conclude. \n \n They called for further research into the impact coffee and caffeine may have on developing melanoma. \n \n Previous studies have shown that regular coffee consumption may help reduce the risk of other serious conditions including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, depression, liver disease and even early death. The beverage's antioxidant properties have also long been associated with reducing the risk for other types of skin cancer. \n \n One study published in 2012 in the journal Cancer involved 113,000 adults followed for 20-plus years. In that time, 22,800 participants developed basal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer, which is rarely fatal. The study found that people who drank more than three cups of coffee were 17 percent less likely to develop basal cell carcinoma, compared with those who drank coffee less than once a month.",
    "summary": "– Heavy coffee drinkers who worry about their habit can at least bear this in mind: They have a lower risk of getting skin cancer, according to a large-scale study. Researchers found that people who downed four cups a day have a 20% lower risk of developing malignant melanoma, which CBS News notes is the fifth most common cause of cancer in the US and the deadliest form of skin cancer. The study crunched data from 447,000 adults who were tracked over 10 years. The more coffee they drank, the less likely they were to develop melanoma. The scientists from the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health and the Yale School of Public Health emphasize that this \"modest\" decrease in risk obviously doesn't mean coffee drinkers can skip the sunblock, reports the LA Times. The study shows only a link, not a cause-and-effect, and researchers can't say for sure what's going on. But the findings generally didn't apply to decaf drinkers, so one theory is that caffeine plays some role in the protection, reports LiveScience. (Those who find coffee bitter might try it in a white mug.)"

    "document": "FILE PHOTO: Tourists look down an ancient Roman cobbled street at the UNESCO World Heritage site of Pompeii, October 13, 2015. REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo \n \n ROME (Reuters) - The volcanic eruption that destroyed the ancient Roman city of Pompeii probably took place two months later than previously thought, Italian officials said on Tuesday. \n \n Historians have traditionally dated the disaster to Aug. 24 79 AD, but excavations on the vast site in southern Italy have unearthed a charcoal inscription written on a wall that includes a date which corresponds to Oct. 17. \n \n The writing came from an area in a house that was apparently being renovated just before the nearby Mount Vesuvius erupted, burying Pompeii under a thick blanket of ash and rock. \n \n “Being charcoal, fragile and evanescent, which could not last a long time, it is more than likely that it was written in October 79 AD,” said Massimo Osanna, head of the Pompeii site. \n \n The Aug. 24 date derives from an account of the blast given by Pliny the Younger, who witnessed the eruption and wrote about it almost 30 years after the event in two letters to his friend, the Roman historian Tacitus. \n \n However, previous excavations have uncovered a calcified branch bearing berries that normally only come out in autumn. The discovery of some braziers over the years also suggested the disaster did not strike at the height of summer. \n \n Osanna suggested the correct date might have been Oct. 24. \n \n Showing off the faint writing on an uncovered white wall, Culture Minister Alberto Bonisoli hailed it as an “extraordinary discovery”. \n \n “Today, with a lot of humility, maybe we’re rewriting the history books because we’re dating the eruption to the second half of October,” Bonisoli said. ||||| Written by Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN \n \n Newly discovered graffiti at the Pompeii archeological site could settle an old academic debate about the exact date of the Vesuvius eruption, rewriting the history of one of the ancient world's most significant events. \n \n Excavations in the Regio V area of the city unearthed a charcoal inscription on the wall of a room that supports the theory that the eruption occurred in October, not August of the year 79 AD, as told by history books. \n \n While not listing a year, the graffiti reads: \"XVI K Nov,\" meaning the 16th day before the calends of November, or October 17 in the modern calendar. \n \n Since charcoal is a \"fragile and evanescent\" material, it is very unlikely it could have been able to survive long, according to archeologists. \n \n Frescoes in the Criptoporticus Domus at UN World Heritage Site of Pompeii. Credit: MARIO LAPORTA/AFP/Getty Images \n \n \"It is highly probable that it can be dated to the October of AD 79, and more precisely to a week prior to the great catastrophe, which according to this hypothesis occurred on the 24th October,\" the archeology team said in a statement. \n \n Archeologists found the inscription in a house that was in the process of being renovated at the time of the eruption, so the writing would have probably been covered with plaster shortly. \n \n \"That could help explain why, next to rooms with frescoed walls and ceilings, and with cemented floors -- in some cases with tiles or marble slabs -- there were some areas with plastered walls or even without floors, like the atrium and the entrance corridor,\" archeologists said. \n \n People explore the Fullonica Stephanus Domus. Credit: MARIO LAPORTA/AFP/Getty Images \n \n Italian Culture Minister Alberto Bonisoli, who visited the site on Monday, called it \"an extraordinary discovery.\" \n \n The conventional theory that the eruption took place on August 24 is because of the only eyewitness account of the event, written by Pliny the Younger 25 years later. The Roman author was 17 at the time of the eruption, which he observed from the other side of the Bay of Naples. \n \n Previous findings of chestnuts and woolly clothing hinted at a later date for the traumatic event. The newly found graffiti might settle the debate for good. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Pompeii was famously destroyed on 24 August in 79 AD - or was it? \n \n Archaeologists in Italy have uncovered an inscription they say may show that the history books have been wrong for centuries. \n \n Historians have long believed that Mount Vesuvius erupted on 24 August 79 AD, destroying the nearby Roman city of Pompeii. \n \n But now, an inscription has been uncovered dated to mid-October - almost two months later. \n \n Italy's culture minister labelled it \"an extraordinary discovery.\" \n \n \"The new excavations demonstrate the exceptional skill of our country,\" Alberto Bonisoli said. \n \n Historians have been able to date the eruption of Vesuvius with apparent certainty thanks to ancient writings that purported to share first-hand accounts. \n \n They came from Pliny the Younger, an elite lawyer and author of ancient Rome, who wrote about the death of his even more famous uncle, Pliny the Elder. \n \n \"On the 24th of August, about one in the afternoon, my mother desired him to observe a cloud...\" he wrote in a letter to Tacitus, a Roman senator and historian, about the events of that day. \n \n According to his account, Pliny the Elder was then a fleet commander at Misenum - modern day Miseno - across the bay from Pompeii. He took a ship to stage a rescue for those in danger from the volcano. \n \n But he did not return from the venture. \n \n Pliny the Younger, meanwhile, watched the destruction unfold from the other side of the bay. \n \n \"I have faithfully related to you what I was either an eye-witness of myself or received immediately after the accident happened, and before there was time to vary the truth,\" he wrote. \n \n But the latest discovery calls such certainty into question. \n \n Image copyright EPA Image caption A simple charcoal scrawl may prove centuries of historical texts wrong \n \n The inscription discovered in the new excavations is nothing more than a scrawl in charcoal, likely made by a worker renovating a home. \n \n But it is dated to 16 days before the \"calends\" of November in the old Roman calendar style - which is 17 October in our modern dating method. \n \n \"Since it was done in fragile and evanescent charcoal, which could not have been able to last long, it is highly probable that it can be dated to the October of AD 79,\" the archaeology team said in a statement. \n \n They believe the most likely date for the eruption was, in fact, 24 October. \n \n There has long been some speculation that the eruption happened later than August, particularly centred around evidence of autumnal fruits and heating braziers discovered in the ruins. \n \n The charcoal inscription supports that theory, the Pompeii archaeology team said. \n \n Image copyright EPA Image caption The latest excavations at Pompeii are uncovering 2,000-year-old works of art \n \n So did Pliny the Younger record things incorrectly? \n \n His letter to Tacitus was written some 20 years after the eruption in 79 AD. And the original copies have not survived the intervening 1,939 years. \n \n Instead, our modern reading of the text is based on translations and transcriptions made over the centuries. In fact, various copies of the letters have contained dates ranging anywhere from August to November - though 24 August has long been accepted. \n \n The differences between the texts could easily have been influenced by confusion over the ancient and modern systems of counting days. \n \n The discovery was made in the new Regio V excavation, uncovering previously untouched areas of the ancient city. \n \n In addition to the simple inscription, grand houses have been unveiled this week with elaborate frescoes and mosaics.",
    "summary": "– A construction worker's ancient jotting on a wall might rewrite the history books. The wall scrawl suggests that the Roman city of Pompeii was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in October of AD79, two months later than historians have long believed, reports the BBC. Uncovered by archaeologists in a previously untouched area of the city, the charcoal writing perhaps left by a worker renovating a home gives the date of the work as \"XVI K Nov\" or 16 days before November, meaning Oct. 17 in our modern calendar, per CNN. The problem is that historical records point to an August eruption. For instance, Pliny the Younger described his uncle, Pliny the Elder, setting out from Miseno, across the Bay of Naples from Pompeii, on Aug. 24 in a rescue attempt from which he never returned. The charcoal marking isn't the first discovery to hint at an error, though. CNN mentions previous discoveries of woolly clothing and chestnuts—items that suggest the fall rather than the summer—while Reuters adds a note about a calcified branch of autumn berries. Suggesting an actual eruption date of Oct. 24, archaeologists say that Pliny the Younger might have forgotten the real date (his account of the eruption came 25 years later) or that it could have been lost along with his original writings. It's \"an extraordinary discovery,\" says Italy's culture minister. (It follows the first body found in decades at Pompeii.)"

    "document": "BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- If you get a warm, fuzzy feeling after watching cute cat videos online, the effect may be more profound than you think. \n \n The Internet phenomenon of watching cat videos, from Lil Bub to Grumpy Cat, does more than simply entertain; it boosts viewers' energy and positive emotions and decreases negative feelings, according to a new study by an Indiana University Media School researcher. \n \n The study, by assistant professor Jessica Gall Myrick, surveyed almost 7,000 people about their viewing of cat videos and how it affects their moods. It was published in the latest issue of Computers in Human Behavior. Lil Bub's owner, Mike Bridavsky, who lives in Bloomington, helped distribute the survey via social media. \n \n \"Some people may think watching online cat videos isn't a serious enough topic for academic research, but the fact is that it's one of the most popular uses of the Internet today,\" Myrick said. \"If we want to better understand the effects the Internet may have on us as individuals and on society, then researchers can't ignore Internet cats anymore. \n \n \"We all have watched a cat video online, but there is really little empirical work done on why so many of us do this, or what effects it might have on us,\" added Myrick, who owns a pug but no cats. \"As a media researcher and online cat video viewer, I felt compelled to gather some data about this pop culture phenomenon.\" \n \n Internet data show there were more than 2 million cat videos posted on YouTube in 2014, with almost 26 billion views. Cat videos had more views per video than any other category of YouTube content. \n \n In Myrick's study, the most popular sites for viewing cat videos were Facebook, YouTube, Buzzfeed and I Can Has Cheezburger. \n \n Among the possible effects Myrick hoped to explore: Does viewing cat videos online have the same kind of positive impact as pet therapy? And do some viewers actually feel worse after watching cat videos because they feel guilty for putting off tasks they need to tackle? \n \n Of the participants in the study, about 36 percent described themselves as a \"cat person,\" while about 60 percent said they liked both cats and dogs. \n \n Participants in Myrick's study reported: \n \n They were more energetic and felt more positive after watching cat-related online media than before. \n \n They had fewer negative emotions, such as anxiety, annoyance and sadness, after watching cat-related online media than before. \n \n They often view Internet cats at work or during studying. \n \n The pleasure they got from watching cat videos outweighed any guilt they felt about procrastinating. \n \n Cat owners and people with certain personality traits, such as agreeableness and shyness, were more likely to watch cat videos. \n \n About 25 percent of the cat videos they watched were ones they sought out; the rest were ones they happened upon. \n \n They were familiar with many so-called \"celebrity cats,\" such as Nala Cat and Henri, Le Chat Noir. \n \n Overall, the response to watching cat videos was largely positive. \n \n \"Even if they are watching cat videos on YouTube to procrastinate or while they should be working, the emotional pay-off may actually help people take on tough tasks afterward,\" Myrick said. \n \n The results also suggest that future work could explore how online cat videos might be used as a form of low-cost pet therapy, she said. \n \n For each participant who took the survey, Myrick donated 10 cents to Lil Bub's foundation, raising almost $700. The foundation, Lil Bub's Big Fund for the ASPCA, has raised more than $100,000 for needy animals. \n \n ### ||||| \n \n Lil Bub, arguably the Internet’s best cat. (Mark Ralston/AFP via Getty Images) \n \n It’s 2 p.m. You’re tired, disgruntled and desk-bound. Casting about for something — anything! — to carry you to 5, you contemplate a coffee or an office walk-around. \n \n But not so fast, dear office drone, because there’s a guaranteed mood-lifter you can indulge in at your desk. Just head on over to YouTube, place your cursor in the search box, and type … “cat.” \n \n This is, at least, my personal takeaway from a new study in a forthcoming issue of the journal Computers in Human Behavior, on what author Jessica Gall Myrick calls the “understudied” field of “online cat media.” \n \n [From Grumpy Cat to Lil Bub, Internet cats are serious business] \n \n “Consumption of online cat-related media deserves empirical attention,” Myrick writes, “because, as the news accounts suggest, Internet users spend a significant amount of time consuming cat-related media, some of that while they are supposed to be doing other tasks like working or studying.” \n \n … Yep, been there. \n \n For this paper, Myrick — an assistant professor at Indiana University and a researcher into media’s emotional effects — recruited 7,000 people for a lengthy online questionnaire about when, where and why they watch cat videos. \n \n On average, her respondents watched cat videos two to three times a week, frequently on sites such as Facebook, YouTube and Buzzfeed. They tended to chance upon the videos in their social feeds, rather than seek them out specifically. They were more likely to watch and like cat videos if they owned, or had ever owned, a cat; if they were shy; or if, predictably, they spent lots of time online. \n \n No matter the personal variables, however, people reported feeling more energetic, more happy and less stressed after watching a video of a cat — even when they felt guilty about it because they were supposed to be doing something else. \n \n “Practically,” Myrick writes, “these findings … promote the idea that viewing Internet cats may actually function as a form of digital pet therapy and/or stress relief for Internet users.” \n \n Digital pet therapy? Don’t mind if I do! \n \n As silly and frivolous as this may seem, however (particularly since cats have become the shorthand for Internet frivolity), Myrick’s research actually goes pretty far toward explaining why we have the Internet we do. In short, the social Web doesn’t favor clickbait and cat GIFs because it’s inherently shallow or stupid — but because that stuff feels good. \n \n [You should actually blame America for everything you hate about ‘Internet culture’] \n \n Incidentally, that framework on media consumption predates Internet cat videos: It’s called “mood management theory,” and it was proposed by the German researcher Dolf Zillmann more than 25 years ago. People gravitate toward pieces of content, Zillman argued, that will either (a) make them feel better or (b) maintain their current good moods. It explains, per previous research, why unhappy people generally choose more upbeat music, for instance, and why women experiencing PMS watch more TV comedies than other women do. \n \n Could MMT also explain the rise of Buzzfeed and Upworthy and Emergency Pugs? Or the Internet’s apparent preference for memes and GIFs and goats over far more serious subjects? \n \n Those are questions for future research, of course. But — ugh, sigh — more research means more work. \n \n Perhaps, to lift your spirits, watch a little Maru first! \n \n Liked that? Try these!",

    "document": "Short man syndrome really does exist, Oxford University academics have found, after a study showed feeling smaller makes people paranoid, distrustful and scared of others. \n \n Scientists used virtual reality technology to reduce the height of volunteers travelling on a computer-simulated Tube train by 10in (25cm). \n \n The experience of being shorter increased reports of negative feelings, such as being incompetent, dislikeable or inferior. \n \n It also heightened levels of mistrust, fear and paranoia. Height-reduced participants were more likely to think someone else in the virtual train carriage was deliberately staring, thinking badly about them, or trying to cause distress. \n \n Researchers believe the findings demonstrate the psychologically detrimental effect of experiencing social situations from a position closer to the ground. \n \n Professor Daniel Freeman, who led the Medical Research Council-funded study, said: \"Being tall is associated with greater career and relationship success. \n \n \"Height is taken to convey authority, and we feel taller when we feel more powerful. It is little wonder then that men and women tend to over-report their height. \n \n \"In this study we reduced people's height, which led to a striking consequence: people felt inferior and this caused them to feel overly mistrustful. This all happened in a virtual reality simulation, but we know that people behave in VR as they do in real life. \n \n \"It provides a key insight into paranoia, showing that people's excessive mistrust of others directly builds upon their own negative feelings about themselves. \n \n “The important treatment implication for severe paranoia that we can take from this study is that if we help people to feel more self-confident then they will be less mistrustful.” \n \n Participants in the study experienced the same simulated tube journey twice, once at their normal height and the second time from the perspective of someone 10in (25cm) shorter. \n \n On both journeys, the other virtual passengers in the carriage were programmed to be \"neutral\" and not do anything to provoke feelings of fear or mistrust. \n \n Generally the lowering of height was not consciously registered by the volunteers, but its effects were unmistakable. \n \n \"The results were very clear: lowering of height led to more negative evaluations of the self compared with others and greater levels of paranoia,\" said the scientists writing in the journal Psychiatry Research. \n \n The findings were said to lend support to previous studies linking height and social status, and show how low self-esteem can lead to paranoid thoughts. \n \n Professor Hugh Perry, who chairs the MRC Neurosciences and Mental Health Board, said: \"For people whose lives are affected by paranoid thinking, this study provides useful insights on the role of height and how this can influence a person's sense of mistrust.\" ||||| How tall are you? How tall would you like to be? And how tall do you tell other people you are? \n \n Most of us – and especially men – tend to exaggerate our height, adding a centimetre or two when we think we can get away with it. This is understandable: ours is a culture that valorises the tall and belittles, as it were, the short. As a result, being tall brings with it a host of advantages. \n \n The taller you are, for instance, the more likely you are to go on to higher education. This is true even after controlling for cognitive ability, suggesting that some kind of subtle – indeed unconscious – bias may be operating among educators. Being tall is also associated with career success: in fact it has been estimated that a person who is six feet tall is likely to earn around £100,000 more over the course of a 30-year career than someone who is five foot four. And as if this weren't sufficient, being tall is likely to help in your romantic life too: altezza mezza bellezza, as the Italians say – height is half of beauty. Thus taller adolescents of both sexes typically date more than their shorter peers, and tall men are more likely to find a long-term partner, or indeed several. (It's not all roses for the tall, however: they are more likely to be bitten by midges.) \n \n Given that tall people appear to have the world at their feet, insect bites notwithstanding, it's hardly surprising that they also enjoy certain psychological benefits. For males in particular, height seems to be linked to greater happiness and self-esteem (though some studies suggest that the effect is modest), and a markedly reduced rate of suicide. \n \n Doubtless these psychological advantages stem in part from the pervasive tendency to associate height with power. That tendency is embedded in our language: we \"look up\" to people we consider superior; those without influence are the \"little people\". Height is taken as an index of leadership ability: among US presidential candidates, for example, the tallest usually wins the popular vote (though not necessarily the presidency). Taller presidents stand a better chance of being re-elected. And presidents tend to be much taller than average for men of their age. Moreover, we don't merely assume the tall are powerful; when we feel more powerful ourselves we tend to overestimate our height. \n \n If height and self-esteem are so enmeshed, what are the psychological consequences of feeling smaller than usual? That was the question we set out to explore in a recent experiment. Our hunch was that the experience would cause people to view themselves more negatively, reducing their sense of status and self-esteem, and triggering a sense of vulnerability. And, because these psychological traits play a major part in paranoia, we wanted to see whether lowering a person's height would change the way they viewed other people's intentions towards them. (Clearly there are times when it's sensible to be wary, but the term paranoia denotes unjustified fear.) \n \n How can someone experience the same situation from differing heights? We opted for immersive virtual reality. In collaboration with computer scientists we recruited 60 women from the general population. These women, like 50% of all individuals, had recently experienced a mistrustful thought, but had no history of severe mental illness. (Being tall has advantages for both men and women, but there are minor differences, and so we decided to test a single-sex group.) We asked the volunteers to take a simulated tube train journey wearing virtual reality headsets. While they walked around in the VR world, the sounds of a typical platform and tube journey – the rumble of the train, the hum of other passengers' conversations – were played to the participants through headphones. And as normal in the tube, there were plenty of other people around: in this case computer-generated avatars. \n \n Virtual reality had two great attractions for us. First, even though you're wearing a VR headset and headphones, your mind and body will respond as if the scenario were real. Second, by programming the avatars to behave in a strictly neutral fashion, we knew that any sense the participants had of their fellow passengers being hostile was unjustified and hence evidence of paranoid thinking . \n \n The participants took the virtual tube journey twice: once at normal height and once with their perspective altered to mimic how the scene would look if they were about a head's height shorter (the order of journeys was randomised). The results were dramatic: when they felt smaller, the participants reported increased feelings of inferiority, weakness, and incompetence. And this explained why they were also more likely to experience paranoid thoughts: for example, that someone in the carriage was being hostile or trying to upset them by staring. \n \n We didn't tell the participants that we'd lowered their height, and very few noticed. \"It felt different in the two times. I felt more vulnerable the first time [lowered condition], and also the man with the legs in the aisle was acting in a hostile way towards me the first time, but I didn't feel it so much the second time, even though his legs were in the same place, I don't know why!\" was a typical comment. Another participant remarked: \"I felt more intimidated the first time [lowered condition], not sure why. There was a girl who kept putting her hand to her face, the man with the blue T-shirt was shaking his head at me, they were staring more at me.\" \n \n What does this experiment tell us about how to combat paranoia? (It's worth noting, incidentally, that paranoia is much more common than traditionally assumed: around one in five people experience these kind of thoughts on a regular basis, though only a much smaller number suffer from serious persecutory delusions.) Well, it confirms that paranoia is rooted in a sense of inferiority. In situations that make us feel especially small and unconfident our sense of vulnerability can increase, making it more likely that we'll overestimate the danger facing us from other people. \n \n From this it follows that by helping someone to feel more positively about themselves we may be able to reduce their susceptibility to paranoid thoughts (this is an intervention we're currently testing). Virtual reality could be an asset here: if simulating a decrease in height lowers self-esteem, then the opposite may be true too. By allowing people with problematic paranoia to feel taller in VR social situations, we may be able to boost their confidence in the real world. Because although we can't do much about our actual height, we can certainly learn to feel taller. And when it comes to boosting self-esteem, that may make all the difference. \n \n Daniel Freeman (6' 2\") and Jason Freeman (6', perhaps) are the authors of Paranoia: The 21st Century Fear, published by Oxford University Press. \n \n Daniel Freeman is a professor of clinical psychology, and a Medical Research Council (MRC) senior clinical fellow, in the department of psychiatry at the University of Oxford, and a fellow of University College, Oxford.

The virtual passengers were set up to behave in a \"strictly neutral fashion\" in both scenarios, Freeman writes in the Guardian.

Soon after, according to our source, it was announced to employees that he would not be returning. We're told he was not involved in the fall collection, which was designed instead by Balmain's in-house team and stylist Melanie Ward, who took over for Emmanuelle Alt, the new editor-in-chief of French Vogue following Carine Roitfeld's departure. \n \n Balmain's owner, M.

Shocked members of the audience speculated it was the result of a breakdown fueled by drugs. Immediately after the show, Hint Magazine reported that the designer has been in a mental hospital since January. The president of the fashion company told reporters that Decarnin was not there because he was tired after working on the collection until 5 a.m. But as a Balmain spokesperson told The Daily Beast, the designer “is not feeling well” and “by doctor’s orders needs rest, and that is the only reason he was not present at the show.” \n \n After the last model walked off the runway at Balmain’s Fall/Winter 2011 show on Thursday morning, the audience waited expectantly for Decarnin to appear for his final bow. But instead, a security guard stepped onstage, and the lights went up in the house. Gasps spread through the crowd, and a scrum of reporters descended on Balmain’s owner, M. Alain Hivelin. “He’s tired after working on the collection,” Hivelin insisted. The Telegraph’s Hilary Alexander – who was in the crowd of journalists – misheard. Tired? Or retired? \"No, he's not retired. He's just tired. He didn't go to bed until 5 a.m. He's not here, he's resting,\" Hivelin told her. But a Balmain spokesperson contradicted Hivelin, telling The Daily Beast that Decarnin hadn’t, in fact, been working on the collection until 5 a.m.: “What he meant is that he was exhausted,” the spokesperson said. “He has been exhausted because this season was particularly demanding and complicated. “ \n \n The spokesperson says that the rumors about a breakdown from drugs and the mental hospital are “completely untrue.” The spokesperson wouldn’t say the cause of his ailment, only that it was “not anything physical.” \n \n After the show, Hint Magazine reported via an anonymous source that Balmain told employees back in mid-January that the designer would not be returning. According to the magazine’s blog, Melanie Ward, the house’s stylist, had completed the collection herself. (Ward, who was seated in the audience, fielded questions about the collection from reporters after the show.) \n \n But again, the spokesperson denies that the collection was completed without Decarnin. “This collection was done under his directives,” the spokesperson said. “But in the last weeks, he hasn’t been involved 100 percent—or as much as he would like.” The spokesperson says only that this season was executed by the house’s “loyal” design team – and that it is this design team that will continue to work until Decarnin has recovered and resumed work at an unknown time. \n \n Decarnin, 46, has been at Balmain since 2005, where he has become known for a rock 'n’roll aesthetic: skin-tight dresses, chainmail—and extraordinarily high prices.

    "document": "Shellfish Industry Lobs Bomb at Sea Otters LOS ANGELES (CN) - The federal government's termination of a sea otter management zone in Southern California will be disastrous for the shellfish industry, as otters are voracious eaters of urchins, abalone and lobster, commercial fishermen claim in court. \n \n The California Sea Urchin Commission and three other industry groups sued the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service for its termination of a program enacted by Congress in 1986 that created an \"otter-free\" management zone south of Point Conception in Santa Barbara County. \n \n Killing the program \"will lead to a population approaching 300 otters residing within the management zone within a decade. Consequently, sustainable shellfish and other marine fisheries in Southern California will be severely compromised if not destroyed,\" the fishermen say in the federal complaint. \n \n Plaintiffs include Other plaintiffs the California Abalone Association, the California Lobster and Trap Fishermen's Association, and Commercial Fishermen of Santa Barbara. \n \n The sea otter was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act in 1977, due to habitat loss, hunting, and risks from a Southern California oil spill. To protect the otters, the Marine Mammal Commission proposed relocating California sea otters. \n \n But \"the fishing community was greatly opposed to expanding the otter's range, reasonably fearing that the otter would destroy shellfish and other marine resources,\" the complaint states. \n \n Congress enacted Public Law 99-625 \"to balance the otter's recovery needs with the interests of fishermen,\" the industry groups say. \n \n The plan moved an experimental population of 140 southern sea otters from Monterey Bay to San Nicolas Island. \n \n \"The plan authorized San Nicolas Island as the home for the experimental population, and defined the island, along with its near-shore waters, as the translocation zone. The rest of the California Bight, south of Point Conception to the Mexican border, the Service designated as the otter-free management zone,\" the commission says in the complaint. \n \n \"The dual purpose of the 'management zone' was to make containment of the experimental population within the translocation zone easier, and 'to prevent, to the maximum extent feasible, conflict with other fishery resources within the management zone by the experimental population.'\" \n \n Fish & Wildlife was to use non-lethal means to capture sea otters in the management zone and return them to the translocation zone. Fishermen who accidentally killed otters that swam into or past the management zone could not be federally prosecuted, according to the complaint. \n \n But the San Nicolas population did not thrive; many otters died or did not stay at the island. The Service stopped removing otters from the management zone in 1993 and issued a revised recovery plan in 2003, recommending that the management zone no longer be maintained. \n \n On Dec. 19, 2012, the Service decided to terminate the translocation program, finding that it failed because only 17 otters remained on San Nicolas Island due to emigration, according to the complaint. \n \n The program's termination means that fishermen can again be held liable for accidentally killing, or \"taking,\" otters in Southern California waters. It will reduce populations of invertebrate prey species in the waters, which will hurt the plaintiffs, the complaint states. \n \n The plaintiffs say they are \"gravely concerned with the negative impacts of otter predation upon shellfish. Within the last decade, the vast majority of sea urchin harvest in California has occurred in the otter management zone. The Channel Islands sea urchin resource alone is responsible for 68 percent of California's harvest. \n \n \"Sea urchin is a favorite of the otter. When an otter moves into a new area, it generally will devour the urchin population before selecting other prey. A significant body of research has established that, once the otter moves into sea urchin territory, the commercial urchin resource will collapse owing to the otter's voracious predation,\" according to the complaint. \n \n The California Lobster and Trap Fishermen's Association says it is \"gravely concerned about unregulated otter expansion and the loss of the incidental take exemption, due to otter consumption of lobster and the risks that traps will unintentionally 'take' the otter.\" \n \n The fishermen claim that the Fish & Wildlife Service cannot legally terminate the program because it was enacted by Congress, and Fish & Wildlife did not receive authorization from Congress to kill it. \n \n \"Although Public Law 99-625 provides the Service discretion in whether to commence a translocation program, the Public Law provides no authority to the Service to cease such program once it has been initiated,\" the complaint states. \n \n Friends of the Sea Otter defended Fish & Wildlife in a statement. A spokesman for the environmental group called the industry lawsuit \"just another attempt by a segment of the fishing community to prevent sea otter recovery to advance their narrow economic self-interest, even at the expense of the benefits to the California coastal ecosystem.\" \n \n Jim Curland, advocacy program director for Friends of the Sea Otter, added: \"As it has many times before, Friends of the Sea Otter will again take all actions necessary to meet this legal threat.\" \n \n Defendants include the Department of Interior; Rachel Jacobson, acting assistant secretary for Fish & Wildlife & Parks; and Daniel M. Ashe, director of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. \n \n Plaintiffs ask that the termination of the program be declared null and void. \n \n They are represented by Damien M. Schiff with the Pacific Legal Foundation in Sacramento. ||||| Commercial fishermen have filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for abandoning a program to create an \"otter-free zone\" in Southern California coastal waters that sustain shellfish industries. \n \n The lawsuit, filed this week by the Pacific Legal Foundation on behalf of harvesters of sea urchin, abalone and lobster south of Point Conception, accuses the agency of illegally terminating the program without congressional approval or authorization. Otters are voracious eaters of shellfish. \n \n Federal officials ended the program in January after determining that capturing and trans-locating sea otters that wander into the \"otter-free zone\" was hurting efforts to protect and recover the species — even as it succeeded in protecting shellfish fisheries. \n \n The sea otter population has not risen much in recent years, as the creatures suffer from disease, parasites, inadequate food supplies, shark bites and the occasional bullet wound. An estimated 2,792 now exist off the California coast. \n \n Tuesday, a coalition of environmental groups led by Friends of the Sea Otter announced that it would intervene in the case on behalf of federal wildlife authorities. \n \n \"The problem is that the shellfish industry flourished after sea otters were all but wiped out by the fur trade,\" said Jim Curland, advocacy program director of the nonprofit Friends of the Sea Otter. \"Now, if the fishermen's lawsuit were to prevail, our concern is that harm, injury and even death to sea otters would follow.\" \n \n Pacific Legal Foundation attorney Jonathan Wood argued that the no-otter zone was needed to prevent the furry, button-nose marine mammals from \"ravaging fragile nearby fisheries and destroying local economies.\" \n \n \"We're not attacking sea otters,\" Wood said. \"It's just that without a sea otter management zone, the fisheries our clients rely on will be decimated in 10 to 20 years.\" \n \n Plaintiffs include the California Abalone Assn., the California Lobster and Trap Fishermen's Assn., Commercial Fishermen of Santa Barbara, and the California Sea Urchin Commission, a state panel dedicated to promoting education about the nutritional value of the sea urchin. \n \n \"This case is about balance in environmental policies, and adherence to the rule of law,\" Wood said. \n \n Congress established the \"otter-free zone\" in the late 1980s as part of an effort by federal wildlife authorities to move 140 otters from Monterey Bay to San Nicolas Island, about 60 miles off the coast of Ventura County. \n \n State and federal marine biologists said the program was necessary because sea otters could be threatened with extinction if their breeding grounds off Monterey were hit with an oil spill or disease. They also figured that the small, rocky island was perfectly suited for the 40- to 60-pound mammals because its pristine coastal waters teemed with their favorite foods — abalone, crabs, lobster, mussels and sea urchins. \n \n In a deal with fishermen who worried that moving otters to the island could interfere with commercial harvesting activities, the government declared waters south of Point Conception off limits to otters. \n \n Scientists estimate that about 16,000 Southern sea otters once lived along the California coast before they were hunted nearly to extinction in the 18th and 19th centuries for their pelts. The federal government declared them threatened with extinction in 1977 and protected them under the Endangered Species Act. \n \n louis.sahagun@latimes.com ||||| Should sea otters be allowed to repopulate Southern California? \n \n Seems like a strange question, right? \n \n When a highly imperiled species starts to recover in its native habitat, we should all be grateful and welcome them back. This has certainly been the story of the American bald eagle. \n \n First off, let’s establish that these guys are undeniably cute. Did you know otters hold hands while they sleep so as not to be swept away from their loved ones? \n \n And they’re not just adorable. They are also key to the health of California’s kelp forests and the many other marine critters—including shellfish and finfish—that depend on kelp forest habitat. \n \n But being a cute keystone predator hasn’t protected the sea otter. Consider the history. \n \n An estimated 16,000 sea otters once populated California’s shorelines. The species was decimated by Russian and Spanish trappers long before California was even a state. In 1938 when the last remaining population of sea otters was discovered in Big Sur, they numbered just 50. Today, with much effort by government agencies and conservation groups, the population in California hovers at under 2,800 individuals. Even with these efforts, sea otters face many obstacles in the swim to recovery and haven’t exhibited any net increase in population numbers since 2006. \n \n Sadly, in 1986, at the behest of abalone and urchin fishers, sea otters were banned from the entire California coastline south of Point Conception in Santa Barbara County. Because sea otters find abalone and urchins so tasty, they were viewed as competition by folks who harvest our public marine resources and sell them to sushi and fancy seafood restaurants. Never mind that there was never a lack of sea otters, abalone, nor urchins before humans started making money harvesting them. \n \n The ban was enacted in response to fishermen’s complaints after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced its plan to establish a population of sea otters at San Nicolas Island off Ventura County. The idea was that this population would be safe from a catastrophic event like an oil spill that could wipe out otters along the coast. Congress then enacted a law authorizing the so-called “no-otter zone” south of Point Conception, where otters could be trapped and hauled away to other areas. \n \n The Fish and Wildlife Service quickly realized that relocating otters to San Nicolas was causing more harm than good. Some were injured, others died trying to swim back to their preferred habitat along the California coast. The agency stopped those relocation efforts in 1990. \n \n In 2001, the Fish and Wildlife Service announced that it would also stop trapping and removing sea otters from the “no-otter zone” because the program was preventing the otter population from recovering. Finally, sea otters were allowed to do what nature told them to do: go home and multiply. \n \n This week, abalone and urchin fishing interests, represented by the proudly anti-environmental Pacific Legal Foundation, filed a lawsuit to reinstate the ban on sea otters south of Point Conception. Earthjustice and our partners at Friends of the Sea Otter, Humane Society of the United States, Defenders of Wildlife, and the Center for Biological Diversity will defend the decision by the Fish and Wildlife Service.",
    "summary": "– Southern California fishermen have gone to court to protect their catch from sea otters. The industry has filed a federal lawsuit demanding that the US Fish and Wildlife Service reinstate a no-otter zone off part of the coast, reports Courthouse News Service. It seems the sea otters love to hoover up shellfish, and the fishermen are afraid their livelihoods will be wiped out. \"We're not attacking sea otters,\" one of their attorneys tells the Los Angeles Times. \"It's just that without a sea otter management zone, the fisheries our clients rely on will be decimated in 10 to 20 years.\" Some background on the zone he's talking about, from a blog at Earthjustice: Congress authorized it in the 1980s. The idea was to relocate the otters from those fishing grounds to the more isolated San Nicolas Island, a move that was supposed to help both the otters and the fishermen. The problem is that the otters never took to the island and kept trying to return to their original waters. They would often get injured while being trapped and relocated. The Fish and Wildlife Service finally scrapped the no-otter zone in January, and the fishermen say the agency had no authority to do so. Environmental groups worried about the otters' stagnant population (about 2,800 for several years now) are stepping up to defend them in court. \"If the fishermen's lawsuit were to prevail, our concern is that harm, injury and even death to sea otters would follow,\" says a rep from the nonprofit Friends of the Sea Otter.

    "document": "— In 1990, Steven Hager saw a flier that had circulated at a Grateful Dead concert in Oakland, Calif., urging people to meet at Mount Tamalpais at 4:20 p.m. on April 20 for some “420”-ing, the number that had become code for smoking marijuana in California. \n \n Hager, then the editor of High Times magazine, had never heard of it, but he was intrigued. Hager did some research, discovering that the 420 code had first been used in 1971, when five friends at San Rafael High School smoked pot each day at 4:20 p.m. \n \n “I thought, ‘This is important!’ And you know everybody thought I had lost my mind,” said Hager, 63, of New York City. “I started talking to people and I said we will build everything around 420 – 420 is the new everything.” \n \n As marijuana lovers mark their unofficial national holiday Monday on April 20, or 4/20, it’s a testament to Hager’s marketing powers. \n \n Events are scheduled in 420-friendly locales across the country, including 420 smoke-ins, 420 concerts, 420 bake-offs, $4.20 joints sold at 420 pot shops, happy hours at 4:20 p.m., 420 club crawls. People will take 420-friendly shuttles to 420-friendly hotels. Couples will go on 420-friendly dates. And voters will talk to 420-friendly candidates. \n \n Pot lobbyists say the tone of the day has changed as marijuana has moved into the mainstream, with polls showing a majority of Americans backing legalization and voters in Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon and the District of Columbia already approving the drug for recreational use. \n \n “Most of our chapters are in celebration mode,” said Allen St. Pierre, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. “That was not the case 10 years ago; 4/20 was a day of protest.” \n \n St. Pierre said a friend gave him 5 grams of marijuana as a gift for the holiday, often called Weed Day. He planned to invite friends to his home in Washington, D.C., for the evening. \n \n “It’ll be a given that as they come in the door they’ll be given party treats and other things and we will legally consume cannabis,” he said. \n \n Signs of 420 have popped up everywhere and are in high demand. Pot fans cheered when some of the clocks in the 1994 film “ Pulp Fiction” were set at 4:20. Room signs with the number 420 in college dorms have a mysterious way of disappearing. And in Colorado, the state Transportation Department responded to multiple thefts of the 420-milepost sign on Interstate 70 last year by putting up a new marker numbered 419.99. \n \n The biggest events are planned in Colorado, the first state to open recreational marijuana stores, in January 2014. Denver is hosting the High Times Cannabis Cup, where presenters will focus on “emerging edibles,” cannabis concentrates, breeding plants, cultivation techniques and music by Snoop Dogg. \n \n Business types can head to a marijuana investor’s summit in the city. And Boulder-based Bud and Breakfast has offered to rent 420-friendly lodging to out-of-town visitors. \n \n In California, thousands are expected at a smoke-out at Hippie Hill in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park, while a 420 Freedom Fest by 420 Nurses is scheduled in Los Angeles. \n \n New York will host the Reefer Madness Reunion Concert. Texas will have a puff-puff-putt miniature golf tournament. And Oregon will have a cannabis awareness walk. \n \n In Washington state, Seattle will host the 420 Fest, while a 420 cannabis bus tour in Tacoma will take visitors to pot shops. The $10 tour will include speakers who will explain such things as why people get the munchies and what to do if you get too high, but participants won’t be allowed to smoke any pot. \n \n “This is definitely not a party bus,” said Angela Jossy, often known as the “Duchess of Downtown,” who’s organizing the tour. But she added that the day has no significance for her. “I’m actually not a big pot smoker myself. This is really about supporting local business.” \n \n In Washington, D.C., pot fans will conclude a democracy vigil, with a day of music and poetry, sewing circles and roundtable discussions on tap. \n \n Adam Eidinger, who headed the D.C. legalization drive, got a special 420 license plate for his 2015 Jeep Wrangler two weeks ago from the city’s new mayor, Muriel Bowser, who honored the activist for his work. \n \n “This is not something I ever asked for,” Eidinger said. “It’s one of the greatest honors I’ve ever gotten in my life.” \n \n While the 420 phenomenon originated with the five San Rafael teens who called themselves the Waldos, St. Pierre said Hager served as “the real catalyst and visionary” in publicizing it. \n \n “Without him, I don’t think there’s any way that this interesting numerology that has crept deep into American culture and commerce would have happened,” he said. \n \n Other theories have emerged. There are roughly 420 active chemicals in marijuana. And the title of Bob Dylan’s “ Rainy Day Women #12 and 35,” the song where he implores that “everybody must get stoned,” contains two numbers that when multiplied together equal 420. \n \n “The Waldos did invent it – I’m the guy who picked up the flag,” Hager said. “And it’s not any of these other crazy coincidences that people bring up. But it’s just amazing the way this synchronicity exists. That’s the magic of numbers.” \n \n Hager predicted that the 420 mania will only grow. \n \n “It’s just starting to kick off, trust me,” he said. \n \n But it’s already passe for some, similar to drinking alcohol on New Year’s Eve. \n \n “For me, 4/20 is like most party-fueled holidays – it’s amateur hour,” Katie Shapiro, a freelance travel and style writer, wrote in the Denver Post last week. \n \n And for many marijuana users under 30, St. Pierre said there’s a more popular number – 710. If you read the numbers upside down, they spell “OIL.” \n \n “These kids are so much more into the marijuana oils and vapors,” St. Pierre said. “They’ve developed a whole new subculture of marijuana consumption around 710 and they sort of look down their nose on 420.” \n \n In July, Denver will host the 710 Cup, billed as another new celebration of cannabis culture and fashion. \n \n Email: rhotakainen@mcclatchydc.com; Twitter: @HotakainenRob. ||||| Published on Jul 29, 2013 \n \n Bob Dylan performs \"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\" live via satellite for the Farm Aid concert in Austin, Texas on July 4, 1986.

In honor of marijuana's biggest day of the year, potheads nationwide will light up $4.20 joints, throw 4/20 concerts, hold 4/20 bake-offs, ring in 4:20pm—and some will even do it legally, now that the Man has horned in on the action—all in celebration of their favorite, well, herb. \"Most of our chapters are in celebration mode,\" says pot legalization advocate Allen St. Pierre. \"That was not the case 10 years ago; 4/20 was a day of protest.\" But why 4/20? The number of chemicals in pot? The obscure multipliers in that Bob Dylan song? The Fresno Bee checks in with Steven Hager, the former editor of High Times, who says he first saw it referenced at a Grateful Dead show in 1990: A flier being passed around invited potheads to show up at 4:20pm on April 20 for a little \"420\"-ing. Intrigued, Hager dug a little deeper and found \"it's not any of these other crazy coincidences that people bring up.\" The term dated back another two decades to a group of five San Rafael High School students dubbed the Waldos. In 1971, they were given a \"treasure map\" to a weed patch, and agreed to meet after school at 4:20pm. They got high—which eventually turned into a daily after-school activity—and went out searching. \"I thought, 'This is important!' And you know everybody thought I had lost my mind,\" says Hager. \"I started talking to people and I said we will build everything around 420—420 is the new everything.\" And it worked: Hager's pet project is now a marketing juggernaut. \"Without him, I don't think there's any way that this interesting numerology that has crept deep into American culture and commerce would have happened,\" says St. Pierre.

They said the uncle has not been seen publicly since then, indicating he may have been dismissed. \n \n In this Tuesday, Aug. 14, 2012 file photo provided by China's Xinhua News Agency, Jang Song Thaek, North Korea's vice chairman of the powerful National Defense Commission, attends the third meeting on... (Associated Press) \n \n Although Jang Song Thaek has reportedly been purged in the past, only to return to power, there was no official word from North Korea about his fate. South Korean intelligence officials have erred previously in predicting changes in the secretive North, and senior North Korean officials occasionally disappear from state media reports and then reappear. \n \n Jang was last seen in North Korean media on Nov. 6. South Korea's spy agency, the National Intelligence Service, wouldn't confirm the two lawmakers' details about Jang, which came in a closed-door intelligence briefing. One of the lawmakers, Jung Chung-rae, said the NIS didn't tell him how it obtained the information. \n \n The other lawmaker, Cho Wonjin, said the spy agency reported that North Korean authorities were investigating corruption allegations involving Jang's aides. \n \n Jang is married to former leader Kim Jong Il's sister. He was seen as a powerful influence as young leader Kim Jong Un consolidated power after his father Kim Jong Il's death in December 2011. He walked by Kim Jong Un's side as a hearse carried Kim Jong Il's body through Pyongyang. \n \n Jang holds a slew of top posts, including vice chairmanship of the powerful National Defense Commission and membership in the ruling Workers Party's political bureau. Jang has also been a frequent companion of Kim Jong Un on his tours around the country, as he was for Kim Jong Il. He has also been seen as a leading economic policy official. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption Many observers saw Mr Chang as having a major influence on Kim Jong-un \n \n A powerful uncle of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has been removed from his post, South Korean media reports say. \n \n Citing South Korea's intelligence agency, they say Chang Song-thaek, 67, lost his position as vice-chairman of the North's top military body. \n \n Two close aides were also executed for corruption, according to the reports. \n \n If confirmed, Mr Chang's removal would be the biggest upheaval in North Korea's leadership since Mr Kim succeeded his father, analysts say. \n \n Analysis The reports attributed to South Korea's spy agency are difficult to verify. The agency has a patchy record in predicting North Korea's internal changes, and there is little scope to assess the evidence behind the claim. Chang Song-thaek is Kim Jong-un's uncle by marriage. As such, his influence over the leadership is independent from his senior military and political positions. Mr Chang's prestige has increased since the 2011 transition. He is seen as an economic reformer, and is regularly tasked with handling talks with China, Pyongyang's only major ally. His removal, if true, would be a dramatic change, but much would also depend on the reason for his dismissal. If medical problems led to his temporary disappearance from the limelight, this might leave him with great unofficial influence. Political differences or disloyalty would signal a far more serious shift. Either way, like many reports about North Korea's internal politics, the truth of this one may take a long time to emerge. \n \n Kim Jong-un took over after Kim Jong-il died in 2011. \n \n The latest reports emerged from an intelligence briefing given to South Korean lawmakers. \n \n The National Intelligence Service (NIS) made the assessment based on information provided by multiple sources, the South's Yonhap news agency said. \n \n It also quoted the intelligence service as saying two of Mr Chang's closest associates had been executed in public in late November. \n \n 'Power behind Kim' \n \n The BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul says the reports are difficult to verify, and South Korea's spy agency has been proven wrong before. \n \n But if true, the development would mark a significant shift, she adds. \n \n Mr Chang is married to Kim Jong-il's sister. \n \n He has often been pictured beside the elder Kim's son Kim Jong-un and was seen by some observers as the power behind him. \n \n Mr Chang climbed through the ranks of the secretive leadership of North Korea's Korean Workers' Party (KWP) in the 1970s. \n \n In 1992, he was elected to the party's Central Committee. But, despite his senior status, he has been targeted by purges in the past. \n \n Chang Song-thaek Image copyright Reuters Born 1946; marries Kim Jong-il's sister in 1972 \n \n Joins Korean Workers' Party administrative ranks in 1970s \n \n Elected to Central Committee in 1992 \n \n Sidelined in 2004, but rehabilitated in 2006 \n \n 2011: Gets top military post under Kim Jong-un \n \n Nov 2013: Reportedly dismissed Profile: Chang Song-taek Secretive 'first family' \n \n In 2004, despite his place in the Kim family, he disappeared from public view. \n \n One report at the time, citing South Korean intelligence, said Mr Chang had been placed under house arrest. \n \n Others suggested he had been sent for \"re-education\". However, two years later he appeared to have been reinstated. \n \n He was regarded as an economic reformer and a major influence on Kim Jong-un. \n \n He held key positions in both the KWP and the National Defence Commission. \n \n Apart from chronic economic problem, North Korea is involved in a protracted stand-off with its neighbours and Western powers over its nuclear weapons programme. \n \n Tensions between the two Koreas rose after the North's third nuclear test in February. \n \n Angered by expanded UN sanctions and annual US-South Korea military drills, Pyongyang threatened attacks on Japanese, South Korean and US military targets in the region.",

Kim Jong Un's uncle, Jang Song Thaek, has reportedly been fired from his role as vice chairman of the country's powerful National Defense Commission, per South Korea's spy agency. Yonhap reports that Jang \"is widely regarded as the most influential figure in North Korea after Kim\"; some considered the 67-year-old to be the \"power behind\" Kim, the BBC reports. He was last seen in public Nov. 6, and made his last appearance with Kim on Oct. 10. It's unclear why he may have fallen out of favor. South Korea's National Intelligence Service further says a number of sources have confirmed that two of Jang's aides were publicly executed over corruption last month. Jang has apparently faced disagreements with fellow leaders before: Reports in 2004 said he was under house arrest or facing \"re-education,\" but he apparently returned to power two years later. Jang is married to Kim Jong Il's sister, though Yonhap cites reports stating he and his wife have grown apart. As for his relationship with Kim Jong Un, he walked by the leader's side as a hearse carried Kim Jong Il's body through Pyongyang, notes the AP.

It's possible with what the UK's Royal Society of Chemistry calls \"a new paradigm for dental treatments.\" Scientists at Nottingham and Harvard universities say they've developed dental fillings that stimulate stem cells to regrow and heal damaged teeth. Researcher Adam Celiz explains that existing dental fillings—typically made of calcium hydroxide or mineral trioxide aggregate, per Science Alert—are meant to protect pulp tissue in the middle of a tooth containing blood vessels and nerves, but \"are toxic to cells,\" per Newsweek. About 10% to 15% of these fillings fail, resulting in root canals which weaken teeth further. The latest fillings made from synthetic biomaterial, however, \"can be placed in direct contact with pulp tissue to stimulate the native stem cell population.\" Scientists say the stem cells encourage the growth of pulp tissue and dentin—the hard material that forms the majority of a tooth. \"In in vitro testing, the fillings stimulated the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells into dentin,\" reports Popular Science. \"The researchers believe that if used in a damaged tooth, those stem cells can repair the kind of damage that often comes from the installation of a filling. In essence, the biomaterial filling would allow the tooth to heal itself.\" Patients won't need to endure any more suffering than usual, either. The biomaterial is injected into a tooth and hardened with UV light just like a normal filling.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is moving to reverse Obama-era rules barring hunters on some public lands in Alaska from baiting brown bears with bacon and doughnuts and using spotlights to shoot mother black bears and cubs hibernating in their dens. \n \n The National Park Service issued a notice Monday of its intent to amend regulations for sport hunting and trapping in national preserves to bring the federal rules in line with Alaska state law. \n \n Under the proposed changes, hunters would also be allowed to hunt black bears with dogs, kill wolves and pups in their dens, and use motor boats to shoot swimming caribou. \n \n These and other hunting methods — condemned as cruel by wildlife protection advocates — were outlawed on federal lands in 2015. Members of the public have 60 days to provide comment on the proposed new rules. \n \n \"The conservation of wildlife and habitat for future generations is a goal we share with Alaska,\" said Bert Frost, the park service's regional director. \"This proposed rule will reconsider NPS efforts in Alaska for improved alignment of hunting regulations on national preserves with State of Alaska regulations, and to enhance consistency with harvest regulations on surrounding non-federal lands and waters.\" \n \n Alaska has 10 national preserves covering nearly 37,000 square miles (95,830 square kilometers). \n \n The Alaska Department of Fish and Game was \"pleased to see the National Park Service working to better align federal regulations with State of Alaska hunting and trapping regulations,\" Maria Gladziszewski, the state agency's deputy director of the Division of Wildlife Conservation, said in an email to The Associated Press. \n \n She said the proposal is \"progress in that direction, and we appreciate those efforts. Alaskans benefit when state and federal regulations are consistent.\" \n \n Gladziszewski said the state doesn't conduct predator control in national preserves. \"Predator control could be allowed in preserves only with federal authorization because such actions are subject to NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) review,\" she said. \n \n Expanding hunting rights on federal lands has been a priority for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, a former Montana congressman who displays a taxidermied bear in his Washington office along with mounted heads from a bison and an elk. \n \n The Obama-era restrictions on hunting on federal lands in Alaska were challenged by Safari Club International, a group that promotes big-game hunting. The Associated Press reported in March that Zinke had appointed a board loaded with trophy hunters to advise him on conserving threatened and endangered wildlife, including members of the Safari Club. \n \n President Donald Trump's sons are also avid trophy hunters who have made past excursions to Africa and Alaska. \n \n Collette Adkins, a lawyer and biologist with the advocacy group Center for Biological Diversity, expressed outrage at the rollback. \n \n \"Cruel and harmful hunting methods like killing bear cubs and their mothers near dens have no place on our national preserves,\" she said. \n \n The Humane Society of the United States said it would oppose the new rules. \n \n \"These federal lands are havens for wildlife and the National Park Service is mandated to manage these

misguided attempt to increase trophy hunting opportunities, is unlawful and must not be finalized.\" ||||| Washington (CNN) The Interior Department moved this week to end an Obama administration ban on hunting bears in Alaska with bait, artificial light and dogs, along with other hunting practices in the state. \n \n The proposal from the National Park Service, published in the Federal Register on Tuesday, took issue with protections for black bears, \"including cubs and sows with cubs,\" as well as wolves and coyotes, including their pups, from \"harvest practices that are otherwise permitted by the State of Alaska.\" \n \n The 2015 rule now targeted by the National Park Service also prohibited using dogs to hunt black bears and using motorboats to hunt swimming caribou. \n \n Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke came into office moving to expand public hunting ground from day one and issued directives last year aimed at fishing and hunting guidelines from the department. \n \n The park service, in its proposal Tuesday, cited two of Zinke's orders, one calling on the agency to increase access to public lands for hunting and another that the park service said called on it to work with state partners, like Alaska. \n \n Read More ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Obama administration had banned hunters from killing bear cubs in Alaska national parks three years ago \n \n The US has proposed a plan to reverse Obama-era rules barring certain hunting methods in Alaska, including the use of bait to lure and kill bears. \n \n The change would allow hunters to use spotlights to shoot bear cubs inside their dens and hunt black bears with dogs on some Alaskan federal lands. \n \n The agency proposed the changes on Monday, and members of the public have until 23 July to comment on the plan. \n \n Some environmental groups have called the proposal \"inhumane\". \n \n Alaska allowed the use of bait to lure bears for the first time in 2005 in a bid to boost populations of large animals, such as moose, which are preyed on by bears. \n \n This was overturned by the National Park Service (NPS) under the Obama administration in 2015 to avoid altering natural predator-prey dynamics and out of concerns for public safety. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Claire Marshall explores the ethical dilemmas

wildlife managers in Alaska to decide on permitting hunting methods such as luring bears, with foods like sweets or doughnuts, trapping wolves and their pups inside their dens, as well as using motor boats to hunt swimming caribou. \n \n US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's proposal would remove the rules concerning hunting predators to \"align sport hunting regulations in national preserves in Alaska with State of Alaska regulations\". \n \n In the proposal, the state of Alaska claims that the effects of regulating hunting methods \"are likely negligible\". \n \n \"The state asserts the

REUTERS/Bob Strong/File Photo \n \n The plan, pushed by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and assailed by environmentalists as inhumane, would give state wildlife managers the discretion to decide what kinds of bear-hunting methods are permitted across 20 million acres (8 million hectares) of national preserve lands in Alaska. \n \n Alaska in 2005 began allowing grizzly-baiting for the first time since statehood as part of a predator-control program to boost populations of big-game animals popular with hunters such as moose in the state’s vast interior. \n \n The practice of using anything from stale doughnuts and lard to honey-drenched dog food to attract grizzlies into the open for hunters to more easily shoot them was banned in Alaska’s preserves in 2015 by the Park Service under then-President Barack Obama. \n \n The agency determined then that bear-baiting was biologically unsound, potentially unsafe and “inconsistent with federal law authorizing sport hunting in national preserves in Alaska.” \n \n The 2015 rule also prohibited sport hunters, for similar reasons, from using artificial lighting to enter black bear dens as a way of surprising adult animals and their cubs inside, and barred the trapping of gray wolves during their denning season. \n \n The Zinke proposal would likewise lift those restrictions to allow the state Department of Fish and Game to set hunting and trapping rules as its deems appropriate within national preserves, according to Park Service spokesman Peter Christian. \n \n Grizzly bears are believed to number about 30,000 throughout Alaska, while an estimated 100,000 black bears roam the state, according to Fish and Game data. \n \n Alaska officials have said that increased killing of predators such as grizzlies was necessary to increase opportunities for successful hunting of moose and other game creatures favored by sportsmen. \n \n Environmental groups denounced the proposal as unethical and cruel, and said the hunting and trapping practices at issue are also disruptive to the natural predator-prey dynamic. \n \n “The Department of Interior under Secretary Zinke is enabling Alaska’s war on bears and wolves in national preserves,” said Jim Adams of the National Parks Conservation Association. \n \n Veteran hunting guide Thor Stacey, director of government affairs for the Alaska Professional Hunter Association, said his group strongly backs the move to abolish existing restrictions. \n \n “This was a case of the federal government overstepping and trying to usurp the state’s authority to manage its wildlife,” Stacey said. \n \n The proposed rule change, to be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday, marks the latest Obama-era environmental regulation that the Republican administration of his successor, President Donald Trump, had sought to roll back since taking office in January 2017.",
    "summary": "– The Trump administration is looking to dismantle Obama-era rules that made it more difficult to hunt on federal lands, including through the banning of bacon, honey, and doughnuts as bear bait. The 2015 rule also barred the use of dogs to hunt bears, spotlights to shoot bear cubs in dens, motorboats to hunt swimming caribou, and trapping of gray wolves and pups during the denning season, report Reuters and CNN. The Alaska Professional Hunters Association argues \"this was a case of the federal government overstepping and trying to usurp the state's authority to manage its wildlife,\" per the BBC. And the National Park Service apparently agrees, proposing Monday to reinstate the \"harvest practices that are otherwise permitted by the State of Alaska\" after an environmental assessment is carried out. While the public has until July 23 to comment on the proposal, environmentalists are already voicing their opposition. It's \"outrageous\" that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke—who keeps a taxidermied bear in his office, per NBC News—has directed a \"return to these shameful and unethical practices,\" the National Parks Conservation Association says. A lawyer for the Humane Society even argues the \"misguided attempt to increase trophy hunting opportunities\" is unlawful, NBC notes. Use of bear bait was first allowed in Alaska in 2005 in an effort to boost populations of prey animals, like moose. The NPS under the Obama administration considered the method unsafe and at odds with a natural predator-prey dynamic. Under the new plan, Alaska's Department of Fish and Game would decide which hunting methods to permit, per Reuters."

    "document": "Donald Trump has released a list of people who he is apparently going to consider for Supreme Court nominees to replace Antonin Scalia. Off the top of my head the only two names I recognize are Sykes and Willett, who are of course great nominees. \n \n As to the rest, I don’t really plan to do even cursory research about their records, neither do I care. The whole point of this is to allay conservative fears and “prove” that he is better than Hillary because at least he will nominate conservative justices to the Supreme Court. Trump even says so himself: \n \n Trump said in March he planned to release the list of potential nominees to ease concerns about his conservative credentials in the Republican primary. He said then the list would include judges “that everybody respects, likes and totally admires” and “great conservative judges, great intellects, the people that you want.” \n \n Look, if you’re an absolute sucker who’s decided to defenestrate your discernment in order to ease your conscience about pulling the lever for a mentally unstable person in November, you might believe this. If, however, you have a functioning long term memory, you will remember that Trump has lied or flip-flopped about literally everything during the course of this primary. \n \n He just flat out lied or made up interactions between himself and Paul Ryan, and Marco Rubio, and Bob Vander Plaats, lies that were exposed by the written record. He lied about whether he ever acted as his own spokesman. He lied about whether he opposed the Iraq war before it started. He lied about his involvement in the Iran prisoner release. \n \n He flip flopped about his unequivocal promise to release his taxes before the election. Literally the day after becoming the presumptive nominee, he flip flopped on the minimum wage. He flip flopped on his own tax plan. In a closed door session with the New York Times, he flip flopped on his signature promise, which is to build a wall. He flip flopped on the pledge to support the Republican nominee. His own campaign people have overtly said that everything Trump says is just a “suggestion” or an opening bargaining position. \n \n Doing this stuff comes as easily as breathing to Donald Trump. His unrelenting dishonesty and malleability even puts Bill Clinton to shame. And we are supposed to believe that this list, which costs Donald Trump nothing at all, is an iron clad promise and we can totally believe that this list isn’t just a “suggestion” or an “opening bargaining position” with Democrats, and that he won’t end up nominating another Souter. \n \n Sorry, pass. I didn’t fall off the turnip truck yesterday. ||||| With Donald Trump becoming the improbable Republican nominee for president, the party is slowly but surely uniting around him. Conservatives from House majority leader Paul Ryan to Fox News’s Megyn Kelly have met cordially with Trump, signaling that he’s an acceptable candidate. This rapprochement is not a one-way street, either. Trump clearly wants to win, and he needs support – financially and otherwise – from the Republican party to mount a serious challenge to Hillary Clinton. Today, Trump announced a list of potential supreme court nominees – and it’s pretty much everything a conservative activist could hope for. \n \n “This list,” Trump’s Facebook announcement was careful to emphasize, “was compiled, first and foremost, based on constitutional principles, with input from highly respected conservatives and Republican party leadership.” \n \n Trump’s inability to identify a single person of color he considers qualified to be a supreme court justice is telling \n \n The nature of Trump’s supreme court appointments doesn’t come entirely out of the blue. In March, Trump said that he would effectively delegate his potential supreme court nominations to the conservative Heritage Foundation. Whether or not the list he presented today was literally compiled by the think tank, it certainly could have been. Trump’s list does not just seek to appeal to the Republican establishment ideologically. One of those mentioned, Thomas Lee, is the brother of influential Utah senator Mike Lee. \n \n Most of the judges picked, as Trump’s announcement was careful to note, clerked for conservative supreme court justices like Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia or William Rehnquist. The exceptions generally have some other clear signal of commitment to conservative constitutional values on their CV. For example, Texas supreme court Judge Don Willett served in the administrations of several conservative Texas governors. \n \n Ideologically, all of Trump’s potential nominees profile as solid conservatives. No two justices are exactly alike – George W Bush’s two successful nominees, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, vote together most of the time but two of the exceptions prevented the Affordable Care Act from being struck down or substantially damaged. On most issues, a Trump nominee would be as or more conservative than Justice Scalia, whose vacant seat the next president will try to replace. \n \n The most common path to the supreme court in the 21st century is through the federal appellate courts, and Trump’s list has several such candidates, including 11th circuit judge William Pryor, 7th circuit judge Dianne Sykes and 8th circuit judges Raymond Gruender and Steven Colloton, all appointees of George W Bush with solid conservative records. But Trump’s list also has number of judges serving on state courts, including Willett, Colorado’s Allison Eid, Michigan’s Joan Larsen, Utah’s Thomas Lee, and Minnesota’s David Stras. \n \n One notable thing about Trump’s list is their lack of diversity. All 11 are white, and only three are women. Given the problems Trump already faced in attracting the support of minorities, this is a fact that Hillary Clinton is sure to mention more than once. Trump’s inability to identify a single person of color he considers qualified to be a supreme court justice is telling. \n \n On the other hand, Trump’s nominees are more diverse in another respect. Currently, every member of the supreme court received his or her law degree from either Harvard or Yale law school. Trump’s nominees include graduates from the law schools of the University of Chicago, Marquette, the University of Minnesota, Duke, Washington University, Tulane, and the University of Michigan. This does not make up for the lack of racial diversity of Trump’s nominees, but it is something for which Trump deserves credit. Graduates of Harvard and Yale do not have a monopoly on constitutional wisdom, and presidents from both parties would be wise to cast a wider net in that respect. \n \n With the next president having at least one supreme court vacancy to fill and, given that three sitting justices will be or turn 80 during the first term of the next president, the supreme court should be unusually silent during the upcoming election. If you liked Antonin Scalia, you’ll almost certainly like who Donald Trump nominates to replace him. Hillary Clinton, for her part, will surely emphasize the opportunity for the first supreme court with a liberal median vote since early in the Nixon administration. ||||| WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Republican U.S. presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled the names of 11 judges - eight men and three women, all white and all conservative - he would consider, if elected, to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. \n \n Six of them are judges who were appointed to federal appeals courts around the country by Republican former President George W. Bush. The other five serve on various state supreme courts. \n \n Scalia’s replacement could tip the ideological balance of the court, which now is evenly divided with four conservative justices and four liberals. Scalia, who died in February, was one of the court’s most conservative justices. \n \n “We’re going to choose from, most likely from this list,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News. But Trump said he could deviate from the list and added, “At a minimum we will keep people within this general realm.” \n \n All of Trump’s 11 judges are listed as affiliated with the Federalist Society on the influential conservative legal group’s website. The organization is known as a breeding ground for conservative legal thinkers. \n \n It is unusual for a presidential candidate to release names of potential Supreme Court or Cabinet nominees before winning an election. \n \n But Trump is working to assure conservatives in his own party that, if elected president on Nov. 8, he would not appoint a liberal or moderate to the court. Trump allies had encouraged him to announce the names of potential court nominees to allay fears among conservatives wary of a Trump presidency. \n \n Trump’s list includes: Steven Colloton of Iowa, a judge on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals; Raymond Gruender of Missouri, also a judge on the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals; and Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, a judge on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. \n \n It also includes: Raymond Kethledge of Michigan, a judge on the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals; William Pryor of Alabama, a judge on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals; and Diane Sykes of Wisconsin, a judge on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. \n \n The state supreme court jurists include: Allison Eid of Colorado; Joan Larsen of Michigan; Thomas Lee of Utah; David Stras of Minnesota; and Don Willett of Texas. \n \n Democratic President Barack Obama in March named centrist appellate court judge Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy. But the Republican-led Senate has refused to hold confirmation hearings or a vote, insisting that Obama’s successor should get to select Scalia’s replacement. \n \n People line up to visit the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington March 29, 2016. REUTERS/Gary Cameron \n \n Trump said in a statement that the 11 judges were “representative of the kind of constitutional principles I value” and said he would use the list as a guide for nominating a justice. \n \n Willett in the past year has posted several comments on Twitter mocking Trump, even referring to him as “Darth Trump,” a twist on the “Star Wars” villain Darth Vader. Willett last June posted about imagining Trump selecting a Supreme Court nominee. \n \n “The mind reels. *weeps—can’t finish tweet*,” Willett wrote, suggesting he was crying at the idea. \n \n Asked to comment on Willett’s Twitter remarks, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said, “Mr. Trump’s sole focus is considering the best potential individuals based on their constitutional principles.” \n \n SENATOR’S BROTHER \n \n Lee is the brother of Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah, one of the most conservative members of the U.S. Senate. \n \n “I don’t know everyone on the list, but those I do know would all be great Supreme Court Justices. Of course, I do believe one name on that list stands head and shoulders above the rest,” said Mike Lee, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that would consider any nomination. \n \n Sykes is the former wife of conservative Wisconsin radio host Charles Sykes, who posted on Twitter that she would make a great justice but added, “I simply don’t believe Trump.” \n \n Several of the judges have ruled against abortion and reproductive rights. Sykes, Colloton and Pryor have ruled against the Obama administration regarding religious objections to the contraception coverage requirement of the Obamacare healthcare law. \n \n White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at his daily briefing that he would be surprised if any Democrat would describe any of Trump’s picks “as a consensus nominee.” \n \n “But the individual President Obama has put forward is somebody that Republicans have described as a consensus nominee,” Earnest said of Garland, adding that it would be wise for the Senate to act on Obama’s nominee. \n \n Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Eugene, Oregon, U.S. on May 6, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Urquhart \n \n Liberal advocacy group People for the American Way said Trump’s list included “conservative dream justices.” \n \n Most of the 11 judges did not respond to requests for comment. \n \n “Joan Larsen is working along with the rest of Michigan’s Supreme Court to provide common-sense, rule-of-law justice. That is her focus and will remain her focus,” her campaign spokesman Stu Sandler said. Larsen was appointed to the post and is running for election to a full term.",
    "summary": "– For a man more accustomed to choosing reality-TV show contestants, Donald Trump seems to have done a superb job of picking conservative-pleasing potential Supreme Court nominees. The candidate released a list of 11 possible Antonin Scalia replacements on Wednesday, and it's been praised by leading conservatives and denounced by liberals, suggesting Trump made good on his promise to let the conservative Heritage Foundation do most of the choosing for him. A roundup of coverage: The list of nominees, most of whom clerked for Scalia or other conservative SCOTUS justices, is \"pretty much everything a conservative activist could hope for,\" writes Scott Lemieux at the Guardian. He notes that all the nominees are white and only three of them are women, but since all the current justices went to either Harvard or Yale, Trump deserves credit for including graduates of the University of Chicago, Marquette, the University of Minnesota, Duke, Washington University, Tulane, and the University of Michigan. Nan Aron, chief of the liberal Alliance for Justice, says Trump has released a \"dangerous\" list. It \"includes some of the most extreme conservatives on the federal bench today,\" she tells the New York Times. \"Their opinions demonstrate open hostility to Americans' rights and liberties, including reproductive justice and environmental, consumer, and worker protections. They have ruled consistently in favor of the powerful over everyone else. They would move the needle even further to the right on the Supreme Court.\" At the staunchly anti-Trump conservative site RedState, Leon Wolf argues that the candidate has released the list to \"allay conservative fears,\" but anybody who believes Trump is likely to actually nominate any of them may have just fallen off the turnip truck. \"Trump has lied or flip-flopped about literally everything during the course of this primary,\" he writes. Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen tells the AP that her inclusion on the list came as a \"complete surprise.\" She says she's honored to be included and would definitely be interested in serving, though she won't discuss her opinion of Trump. Another candidate, Don Willett of the Texas Supreme Court, has made numerous tweets mocking Trump, reports Reuters. In one, he jokes about \"Darth Trump\" building the Death Star. Another is a haiku about Trump choosing Supreme Court nominees. \"Who would the Donald name to #SCOTUS? The mind reels. *weeps—can't finish tweet*\" he writes."

    "document": "Furious about Russell Simmons denying rape allegations against him, Kelly Cutrone has come forward to say that Simmons attempted to rape her in 1991. \n \n Cutrone, who founded fashion PR powerhouse People’s Revolution and has starred in MTV’s “The Hills” and “America’s Next Top Model,” says she was incensed on Thursday to learn that Simmons was trying to start a #NotMe movement to deny sexual assault accusations that are made as part of the #MeToo movement. She said, “The #NotMe thing? I’m going to do a #YeahYou. F–k you.” \n \n Simmons has been accused of sexual misconduct — including rape — by some 12 women. Although he has stepped down from his companies, including RUSH Communications, he strenuously denies any non-consensual sex. \n \n Cutrone told Page Six that in 1991, when she was 26, she bumped into Simmons — whom she knew as a casual acquaintance — at a party and walked with him to another party. She tells us that he invited her to his apartment, and when she declined, the mogul said he needed to drop in at a friend’s house. Cutrone says she agreed to go, but she believes he led her to his own apartment instead. \n \n “He pushed me into his apartment and then he threw me down on the floor and literally tried to grab … take my clothes off of me,” Cutrone told us, “And I started kicking him really, really hard, screaming, telling him to get the f–k off of me. And that I would have him killed if he ever f–king laid a hand on me.” She added, “I actually think I told him I would call Page Six! I was a publicist! I think I told him I would call Page Six and have him murdered.” \n \n A friend of Cutrone’s, Tatijana Shoan, tells Page Six that she vividly remembers Cutrone telling her ex-husband Ronnie Cutrone — whom Shoan was dating — about Simmons attacking her. \n \n Cutrone told us that after the alleged ordeal, she ran out of the apartment. “[Simmons] was just really shaken up and I f–king split. I remember running out the door and getting a cab and all I remember was that I got in a cab and I remember a feeling — which was so crazy — of, ‘Oh my god. Somebody just tried to rape me. What do I do?’ And then the energy of going to the police and pressing charges against him was overwhelming to me.” \n \n She added, “Then what would happen afterward — and this would happen years afterward — I’d be at a table and Russell f–king Simmons would come up to the table and then people would be like, ‘Kelly, do you know Russell?,’ and I’d be like, ‘Yes, I know Russell — he tried to rape me.'” \n \n Cutrone says she’s was horrified by Simmons’ #NotMe idea, which he unveiled on Instagram on Thursday saying, “My intention is not to diminish the #MeToo movement in anyway, but instead hold my accusers accountable.” Cutrone told us, “It’s a call to every man who wants the right to abuse women to continue.” \n \n see also NYPD investigating sexual assault claims against Russell Simmons The department's special victims unit is looking to speak with... \n \n “All these guys [who have been accused of rape, including Simmons and Harvey Weinstein] have been doing is, like, go, like, ‘Hey, I’m really, really sorry and I’m going to step away from my business,’” said Cutrone, “But you know what, a lot of these women have to go to work everyday because they have to pay bills and they haven’t made $100 million.” Of Simmons — an avid yogi — she added, “I hope he chokes on his om pendant.” \n \n Simmons’ lawyer provided a statement to Page Six which didn’t address Cutrone’s claims, but referred to the mass of allegations against him: “I vehemently deny all these allegations. These horrific accusations have shocked me to my core and all of my relations have been consensual.” \n \n He added that he has “enormous respect for the women’s movement worldwide and their struggle for respect, dignity, equality and power” and said he was “devastated by any reason I may have given to anyone to say or think of me in the ways that are currently being described.” \n \n The statement went on: “In recent weeks, some former business, creative and romantic partners have aired grievances as claims I categorically reject. In some of these instances, financial motives and direct contradictory witness testimony has been supplied to the media, which has been completely left out of stories. In the last few days, one woman attempted to extort me for $500,000 only to recant her ridiculous claim.” \n \n He said, “I have already apologized for the instances of thoughtlessness in my consensual relations. I have separated myself from my businesses and charities in order to not become a distraction.” ||||| (CNN) The New York Police Department has opened an investigation into Russell Simmons based on media reports of multiple women coming forward to accuse the music mogul of sexual misconduct, including rape, a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation said. \n \n The NYPD can open an investigation without a complaint made directly to them, which is the case with Simmons. A group of women told their stories to the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times \n \n Brad Rose, an attorney for Simmons, released a statement Thursday night saying that \"Russell Simmons fully supports and will cooperate with the police inquiry and is confident of a swift resolution.\" \n \n In stories published Wednesday, nine women accused the media mogul of sexual harassment and assault, in incidents alleged to have occurred over decades. Four of those women, Drew Dixon, Toni Sallie, Tina Baker and Sherri Hines accuse Simmons of rape. CNN's policy is not to name victims of sexual assault or rape unless they make their names public. \n \n CNN has not independently verified the women's stories and has reached out to them for comment. \n \n Detectives in the NYPD Special Victims Unit are working to identify the seven women who made the accusations and are reaching out to them as part of the investigation. \n \n In a statement to CNN, Simmons \"vehemently\" denied all the allegations. \"These horrific accusations have shocked me to my core and all of my relations have been consensual,\" he said. \n \n \"I am blessed to have shared extraordinary relationships, whether through work or love, with many great women; and I have enormous respect for the women's movement worldwide and their struggle for respect, dignity, equality and power,\" he said in the statement. \"I am devastated by any reason I may have given to anyone to say or think of me in the ways that are currently being described.\" \n \n On Thursday, Simmons posted a photo on his official Instagram account showing the words,\"NotMe.\" \n \n \"Today, I begin to properly defend myself,\" the caption read. \"I will prove without any doubt that I am innocent of all rape charges.\" (Simmons has not been criminally charged.) \n \n Simmons added that he planned to address some of the accusations against him. \n \n \"My intention is not to diminish the #MeToo movement in anyway, but instead hold my accusers accountable,\" he wrote. \"NotMe Again, this is not a movement against or even in conjunction with #Metoo. It's just a statement about my innocence.\" \n \n #MeToo has become a worldwide movement in which women have shared their stories of being victims of sexual misconduct. \n \n The reports by New York Times and the Los Angeles Times paint a picture of Simmons as a man who wielded his power and influence as both a music mogul and entrepreneur. \n \n Last month, the Los Angeles Times published a story in which Keri Claussen Khalighi said Simmons had forced her to perform oral sex on him in 1991, when she was then a 17-year-old model. \n \n Simmons issued a statement in response to the story at the time of publication but did not address her age. \n \n \"Everything that occurred between Keri and me occurred with her full consent and participation,\" Simmons said. \n \n The entrepreneur recently stepped down from his companies after screenwriter Jenny Lumet wrote a guest column for The Hollywood Reporter in which she accused Simmons of forcing her to have sex with him in 1991. \n \n In response to her column, Simmons said in a statement that he did not have the same interpretation of his time with Lumet. \n \n \"While her memory of that evening is very different from mine, it is now clear to me that her feelings of fear and intimidation are real,\" he said. \"While I have never been violent, I have been thoughtless and insensitive in some of my relationships over many decades and I sincerely and humbly apologize.\"",
    "summary": "– Russell Simmons is now the subject of an NYPD investigation, with 12 women accusing the music mogul of sexual misconduct including rape. The investigation was launched based on accounts published by the Los Angeles Times and New York Times this week, reports CNN. \"We were made aware of the alleged crime through the media, and we anticipate there will be more who come forward,\" an NYPD source tells the LA Times, which notes that at least seven of the encounters are alleged to have occurred in New York City. \"We're in the process of setting up interviews and if any victims want to come forward, they should contact us.\" Sherri Hines, who claims the co-founder of Def Jam Recordings raped her in his New York office in 1983, says she was contacted by police on Thursday. Simmons—who \"supports and will cooperate with the police inquiry,\" according to his lawyer—vowed to defend himself Thursday with an Instagram post featuring a giant \"#NotMe\" atop it. \"I will prove without any doubt that I am innocent of all rape charges,\" he wrote. \"My intention is not to diminish the #MeToo movement in anyway, but instead hold my accusers accountable.\" Meanwhile, fashion publicist and former America's Next Top Model judge Kelly Cutrone tells Page Six that Simmons tried to rape her in 1991. When she refused to go to his apartment, Cutrone says he drove her there anyway, pushed her inside, \"threw me down on the floor and literally tried to … take my clothes off of me.\" She says she fought against him, then ran out the door."

At the Woomera Testing Range, they were able to send an experimental scramjet attached to a rocket booster to an altitude of 278 kilometres with a top speed of Mach 7.5 - more than seven times the speed of sound. \n \n That's far faster than the 'supersonic' Concorde aircraft ever achieved, and passes the threshold for 'hypersonic travel' instead - defined as travel at more than five times the speed of sound. At that speed, you could reach anywhere on the planet in a couple of hours. \n \n Aerospace companies have been working on prototyping what a hypersonic aircraft might look like, including Lockheed Martin (pictured). \n \n Exciting Time \n \n The research programme, called Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation (HIFiRE), is aimed at developing an engine that can fly at Mach 7 reliably. The current speed record for a manned, powered aircraft is Mach 6.72, which was set in the 1960s by the US X-15 experimental aircraft. \n \n \"It's an exciting time... we want to be able to fly with a hypersonic engine at Mach 7,\" Michael Smart, a hypersonics expert involved in the programme, told AFP. \n \n \"The practical application of that is you could fly long distances over the Earth very, very quickly but also that it's very useful as an alternative to a rocket for putting satellites into space.\" \n \n The group's next experiment, scheduled for 2017, will build on this success by detaching the scramjet from the rocket booster and flying it on its own. The project is expected to be complete in 2018. \n \n \"It is a game-changing technology... and could revolutionise global air travel, providing cost-effective access to space,\" Australia's chief scientist Alex Zelinsky said in a statement. ||||| A joint US-Australian military research team is running a series of 10 trials at the world's largest land testing range, Woomera in South Australia, developing the scramjet, a supersonic combustion engine A two-hour flight from Sydney to London is a step closer to reality after the latest successful test Wednesday of hypersonic technology in the Australian desert. \n \n A joint US-Australian military research team is running a series of 10 trials at the world's largest land testing range, Woomera in South Australia, and at Norway's Andoya Rocket Range. \n \n \"It is a game-changing technology... and could revolutionise global air travel, providing cost-effective access to space,\" Australia's chief scientist Alex Zelinsky said in a statement. \n \n Scientists have said hypersonic technology could cut travelling time from Sydney to London to as little as two hours for the 17,000-kilometre (10,560-mile) flight. \n \n Hypersonic flight involves travelling at more than five times the speed of sound (Mach 5). \n \n Scientists involved in the programme—called Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation (HIFiRE)—are developing an engine that can fly at Mach 7, Michael Smart of the University of Queensland told AFP. \n \n \"It's an exciting time... we want to be able to fly with a hypersonic engine at Mach 7,\" said Smart, a hypersonics expert involved in the programme which also includes US aerospace giant Boeing and German space agency DLR. \n \n He added that the scramjet was a supersonic combustion engine that uses oxygen from the atmosphere for combustion of its fuel, making it lighter and faster than fuel-carrying rockets. \n \n \"The practical application of that is you could fly long distances over the Earth very, very quickly but also that it's very useful as an alternative to a rocket for putting satellites into space,\" Smart said. \n \n The experimental rocket in the trial on Wednesday reached an altitude of 278 kilometres and a target speed of Mach 7.5, Australia's defence department said. \n \n Each test builds on previous ones, with the latest used to measure heat on the outside of a vehicle in hypersonic flight, Smart said. \n \n The next test, scheduled for 2017, would involve the scramjet engine separating from the rocket booster and flying on its own, he added. \n \n The first test was conducted in 2009 with the project expected to be completed in 2018. \n \n Explore further: Scientists test superjet technology in Australia",
    "summary": "– A rocket went up over the Australian desert on May 18, but this successful test launch was no ordinary feat: The experimental rocket hit a speed of Mach 7.5—or 7.5 times the speed of sound—qualifying it for \"hypersonic\" status, reports Gizmodo. Military scientists from the US and Australia teamed up on the project, called Hypersonic International Flight Research Experimentation, or HiFire. The goal, reports techradar, is to design an engine that flies at Mach 7, and Wednesday's test is one in a series that will run through 2018. \"It is a game-changing technology ... and could revolutionize global air travel, providing cost-effective access to space,\" says chief Australian scientist Alex Zelinsky, per AFP. To put the feat in more concrete terms, the scientists say such an engine could make a trip from Sydney to London possible in a mind-boggling two hours. (Today's travelers can figure on closer to 24 hours, factoring in connecting flights.) In fact, it would make any trip in the world much more manageable and make it far easier to put satellites in space. But Popular Science also takes note of the military applications: \"With that much speed, it would be impossible for an enemy [to have enough time] to move anything on the ground after radar detected [a] plane, letting it either capture pictures immediately or drop bombs almost unimpeded.\" The next test, in which the engine would separate from the booster rocket, is scheduled for 2017.

    "document": "AMSTERDAM (AP) — Greenpeace has suffered a 3.8 million-euro ($5.2 million) loss on an ill-timed bet in the currency market by a well-intentioned — if reckless — employee in its finance department. \n \n FILE - In this Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2013 file photo, Greenpeace ship 'Arctic Sunrise' is escorted by a Russian coast guard boat, in Kola Bay at the military base Severomorsk on the Kola peninsula in Russia,... (Associated Press) \n \n The environmental group, which is based in Amsterdam, said Monday the employee — who had bet the euro would not strengthen against other currencies in 2013, when it did — had acted beyond the limits of his authority. \n \n Greenpeace International fired the employee, whom it did not identify, but said there was no evidence of fraud. \n \n \"Every indication is, this was done with the best of intentions but not the best of judgment,\" said spokesman Mike Townsley in a telephone interview from Mexico. \n \n He said the organization was deeply concerned that the incident would offend its supporters, and apologized. Greenpeace does not accept contributions from companies or governments and is funded entirely by individuals. \n \n Responsibility lies partly with the employee and partly with the organization, Townsley said. \n \n The employee was a financial expert whose job included currency trades to protect the organization from fluctuations in the market. He was not qualified, however, to undertake trades on the scale he did, Townsley said. In addition, he ignored company rules, under which he should have checked with supervisors and probably hired an external expert for advice on how to manage risks, Townsley added. \n \n \"Hindsight is 20/20, but we believe if he had followed rules and procedures this wouldn't have happened,\" said Townsley. \n \n He said the employee was fired for ignoring rules, not for the loss itself, which — although sizeable compared with donor contributions — amounts to a fraction of the organization's annual revenues of around 300 million euros ($406 million). \n \n Gerald Steinberg, the president of NGO Monitor, which studies accountability at nonprofit organizations, said he wasn't familiar with Greenpeace's finances. But he said 300 million euros is \"a huge amount of money,\" and it puts Greenpeace in the first rank of international non-governmental organizations in terms of size. \n \n He said it would be normal for a nonprofit organization that large to turn to external experts to oversee at least some of the more complex aspects of its finances. \n \n In the 1970s, human rights groups and environmental groups may have been \"mom and pop operations with a lot of volunteers and limited budgets,\" he said. Now any image of head offices filled with \"T-shirts and jeans\" should be discarded. \n \n \"It's big business,\" he said. \"But what you see sometimes at an organization like this is that its ability to manage finances has lagged behind its ability to solicit and raise funds.\" \n \n Townsley of Greenpeace said the organization has already taken steps to strengthen financial controls to prevent such incidents in the future. \n \n The group said it would absorb the loss by cutting planned investments in \"infrastructure\" and pledged not to reduce spending on campaigns and protest actions. ||||| Greenpeace International has parted company with one of its employees after the organisation lost €3.8m (£3m) of donations last year through speculation on currency markets. \n \n n employee at the environmental campaign group's Amsterdam headquarters took out currency exchange contracts that speculated on a weak euro in the second half of 2013, the organisation said in a statement. As a result of the euro strengthening later in the year, Greenpeace had to file record losses when closing accounts at the end of the year. Its 2013 annual report will show a budget deficit of €6.8m. \n \n \"We offer a full apology to our supporters for the series of errors that led to the loss,\" a statement from Greenpeace said. \"We further wish to reassure people that every possible action is being taken to avoid the possibility of such a loss ever occurring again in future.\" \n \n Greenpeace says the staff member, who worked in its international finance unit, was not acting for personal gain, but had failed to obtain authorisation from senior management. He has since been released from his contract. \n \n With an annual income of €72.9m in 2013, the loss of €3.8m represents a significant hit for Greenpeace International, though the environmental group said none of its current campaigns would be affected. Greenpeace International has combined funds from more than 40 national organisations and a global budget of around €300m. \n \n The most significant damage may be to the trust of its supporters: 90% of the organisation's funding comes from small donations of less than €100. \n \n Greenpeace's international programme director, Pascal Husting, told the Guardian that the organisation did not generally use its funds to make investments or speculate on the stock market, but kept money in deposit accounts where it could be withdrawn quickly when needed, such as when 28 of its activists were arrested after staging a protest at a Russian offshore oil rig last year. \n \n However, Husting said that since Greenpeace received most of its donations in euros but had to spend them in other currencies, the organisation was highly exposed to currency fluctuations and took out exchange contracts to protect its assets. \n \n The organisation invests in property, but says this is only in cases where it is considerably cheaper to buy than to rent, such as in Moscow or London.",
    "summary": "– Greenpeace is down $5.2 million thanks to an employee who used the environmental group's cash to gamble on currency markets. The worker wasn't acting for his own gain, but his reckless move left the group with a record loss after the euro strengthened instead of weakening as he had predicted, reports the AP. \"Every indication is, this was done with the best of intentions but not the best of judgment,\" a Greenpeace spokesman says. The group's finance director says Greenpeace is not in the habit of making investments or speculating, but it is highly exposed to currency fluctations and takes out exchange contracts to protect its assets. The worker involved has been fired and Greenpeace has issued a statement apologizing to supporters and stressing that \"every possible action is being taken to avoid the possibility of such a loss ever occurring again.\" The group says none of its current campaigns have been affected, but since 90% of Greenpeace's funding comes from small donations of $150 or less, the damage to the trust of supporters may be its biggest loss from the financial blunder, the Guardian finds."

    "document": "After 22 orbits between the planet and its rings, Nasa plans for Cassini to ‘break apart, melt, vaporize and become part of the very planet it left Earth to explore’ \n \n On its final mission, threading past hazardous cosmic dust and into hurricanes 1.2bn kilometers away, the Cassini spacecraft will end its 20-year journey with humanity’s closest ever look at what goes on in Saturn’s rings and within its clouds. \n \n On Tuesday, Nasa scientists unveiled their plan for the storied spacecraft, and their reasoning for driving Cassini to its own destruction: with the spacecraft running out of fuel, they do not want to risk it crashing into and contaminating Saturn’s moons, where there may be conditions for alien life. \n \n SpaceX becomes first to re-fly used rocket Read more \n \n The tiny moon Enceladus, in particular, has intrigued the researchers. In 2014 and 2015, Cassini found that the frozen moon has an underground saltwater ocean, with geysers spewing plumes high into space, and possibly hydrothermal vents far below the cracked ice. On a flyby, the spacecraft tasted one of those plumes, finding organic chemicals and raising scientists’ hopes that there may be “a brand new paradigm of where bodies may be inhabitable for life”, said Jim Green, director of Nasa’s planetary science division. \n \n “Cassini’s own discoveries were its demise,” said Earl Maize, the mission’s project manager. “We cannot risk an inadvertent contact with that pristine body.” \n \n On another moon, Titan, Cassini found rivers of liquid methane and yet more organic chemicals, which Green said raised the question of “a different potential life environment” that does not require water or a DNA-based system. \n \n The scientists outlined the fate they have devised for Cassini, after 12 years exploring Saturn and its moons. They will direct the spacecraft into Titan’s orbit one last time, using it as a slingshot to drive Cassini into the narrow space – 70,000mph into a 12-mile gap – between Saturn’s atmosphere and its rings, whose fields of dust and debris could threaten the probe. Then Cassini will stay close to the atmosphere, all the while capturing data about the rings and Saturn and using the spacecraft’s antennae as a shield to protect instruments from debris. \n \n “Even a piece of sand at that velocity could take out one of our instruments, or if in the wrong place, could cripple the spacecraft,” Maize said. \n \n The data would be the closest look at Saturn and its rings ever. Project scientist Linda Spilker said Cassini could help solve the mystery of the rings’ origin. If the rings are more massive than expected, she said, they could be ancient, possibly as old as the planet itself. If they are smaller, they may be as young as 100m years old, she said, “maybe a comet torn apart by Saturn’s gravity”. \n \n Cassini could also reveal the composition of the rings, which are mostly water ice but 1% of which remains a total mystery. \n \n With its instruments toward Saturn, Cassini will capture images and data about the giant hurricanes on the planet’s north and south poles, and the massive and enigmatic hexagon at its northmost reaches. The spacecraft could help answer the question of how the hexagon’s sides stay in place, measure the depths of winds on the planet and capture the first measurements of Saturn’s rocky core. \n \n 'Super potato' grown in Mars-like conditions may benefit Earth's arid areas Read more \n \n “We’ll actually be peeling back the atmosphere,” Spilker said. “Flying this close to the rings of a planet, that’s a once in a lifetime experience for a scientist.” \n \n Finally, after 22 orbits between the planet and its rings, Cassini will fall into the clouds. “It will break apart, it will melt, it will vaporize, and it will become part of the very planet it left Earth to explore,” Maize said. Twenty years after scientists from 19 nations and three space agencies launched the spacecraft, they will watch it disappear in about three minutes. \n \n “Going out in a blaze of glory is a phenomenal conclusion,” Maize said, praising the decades of discoveries and research that have come from the mission. \n \n “It has essentially rewritten the books on Saturn,” he said, adding he could not help but feel some sadness at the end of an era. “But it’s just a chapter, the book is not complete.” ||||| This illustration shows Cassini above Saturn's northern hemisphere prior to one of its 22 Grand Finale dives. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech NASA's Cassini spacecraft, in orbit around Saturn since 2004, is about to begin the final chapter of its remarkable story. On Wednesday, April 26, the spacecraft will make the first in a series of dives through the 1,500-mile-wide (2,400-kilometer) gap between Saturn and its rings as part of the mission's grand finale. \n \n \"No spacecraft has ever gone through the unique region that we'll attempt to boldly cross 22 times,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. \"What we learn from Cassini's daring final orbits will further our understanding of how giant planets, and planetary systems everywhere, form and evolve. This is truly discovery in action to the very end.\" \n \n During its time at Saturn, Cassini has made numerous dramatic discoveries, including a global ocean that showed indications of hydrothermal activity within the icy moon Enceladus, and liquid methane seas on its moon Titan. \n \n Now 20 years since launching from Earth, and after 13 years orbiting the ringed planet, Cassini is running low on fuel. In 2010, NASA decided to end the mission with a purposeful plunge into Saturn this year in order to protect and preserve the planet's moons for future exploration—especially the potentially habitable Enceladus. \n \n But the beginning of the end for Cassini is, in many ways, like a whole new mission. Using expertise gained over the mission's many years, Cassini engineers designed a flight plan that will maximize the scientific value of sending the spacecraft toward its fateful plunge into the planet on Sept. 15. As it ticks off its terminal orbits during the next five months, the mission will rack up an impressive list of scientific achievements. \n \n \"This planned conclusion for Cassini's journey was far and away the preferred choice for the mission's scientists,\" said Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. \"Cassini will make some of its most extraordinary observations at the end of its long life.\" \n \n The mission team hopes to gain powerful insights into the planet's internal structure and the origins of the rings, obtain the first-ever sampling of Saturn's atmosphere and particles coming from the main rings, and capture the closest-ever views of Saturn's clouds and inner rings. The team currently is making final checks on the list of commands the robotic probe will follow to carry out its science observations, called a sequence, as it begins the finale. That sequence is scheduled to be uploaded to the spacecraft on Tuesday, April 11. \n \n Cassini will transition to its grand finale orbits, with a last close flyby of Saturn's giant moon Titan, on Saturday, April 22. As it has many times over the course of the mission, Titan's gravity will bend Cassini's flight path. Cassini's orbit then will shrink so that instead of making its closest approach to Saturn just outside the rings, it will begin passing between the planet and the inner edge of its rings. \n \n \"Based on our best models, we expect the gap to be clear of particles large enough to damage the spacecraft. But we're also being cautious by using our large antenna as a shield on the first pass, as we determine whether it's safe to expose the science instruments to that environment on future passes,\" said Earl Maize, Cassini project manager at JPL. \"Certainly there are some unknowns, but that's one of the reasons we're doing this kind of daring exploration at the end of the mission.\" \n \n In mid-September, following a distant encounter with Titan, the spacecraft's path will be bent so that it dives into the planet. When Cassini makes its final plunge into Saturn's atmosphere on Sept. 15, it will send data from several instruments - most notably, data on the atmosphere's composition—until its signal is lost. \n \n \"Cassini's grand finale is so much more than a final plunge,\" said Spilker. \"It's a thrilling final chapter for our intrepid spacecraft, and so scientifically rich that it was the clear and obvious choice for how to end the mission.\" \n \n Explore further: Cassini transmits first images from new orbit ||||| The NASA Cassini mission has studied the Saturn system for many years and will have one final act later this year as it dives into the gas giant.

    "summary": "– Shooting broke out at an all-night art festival early Sunday in Trenton, NJ, sending people stampeding from the scene and leaving one suspect dead and 20 people injured, a local prosecutor said. Mercer County Prosecutor Angelo Onofri told a news conference Sunday that 16 of the 20 injured were treated for gunshot wounds. Four of those, including a 13-year-old boy, were in critical condition, reports the AP. He said that two suspects opened fire during the Art All Night festival that showcases local art, music, and food. One of the suspects, a 33-year-old man, was killed; another suspect is in custody. Authorities say that about 1,000 people were in the area when the shooting started. \"Everybody ran,\" Franco Roberts tells NBC10. Angelo Nicolo told Philadelphia 6ABC TV that he and his brother were at the event when they heard loud popping sounds. He said people started running down the street. \"I saw two police officers escort a guy that got shot in the leg. They bandaged him up and whisked him away,\" Nicolo said. Local television stations showed numerous police vehicles at the scene. The Trentonian said that the venue for the festival was strewn with broken glass and other debris. The event began Saturday afternoon and was scheduled to conclude Sunday afternoon; organizers have canceled the remainder, saying \"we're still processing much of this.\""

    "document": "Yesterday, the President held a landmark meeting with a wide array of leaders in the health care field – insurance companies, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, and providers –who pledged to work together to control costs in health care to the tune of $2 trillion in savings over the next ten years. Today, the President held another meeting with five employers, a state health department, and a union to discuss innovative ideas that are being implemented in the workplace to improve the health of workers and reduce the rising rate of health care spending. \n \n (President Barack Obama listens to Safeway President and Chief Executive Officer Steve Burd during a meeting with business leaders in the Roosevelt Room of the White House to discuss employer health care costs, May 12, 2009.

Official White House Photo by Pete Souza.) \n \n The President directed the Office of Personnel Management to work with the Office of Health Reform, the National Economic Council, the Department of Labor, and the Office of Management and Budget to examine successful employer wellness and prevention practices that lower health care costs and improve employees’ health, and to explore possibilities of developing a plan for federal employees and their workplaces. \n \n More generally, the discussion was designed to expand on the theme that the health care system in America needs comprehensive reform, including a much greater focus on wellness and prevention. As the President stated in his remarks afterwards , \"what we've done here today is to gather together some of these stories and best practices to make sure that they are going to be informing the health care reform discussions that take place here in Washington.\" If these companies have been able to implement proven measures in the private sector, \"there’s no reason why we can’t do that for the country as a whole.\" The White House fact sheet details the attendees and the kinds of practices they have been implementing: ||||| When colleagues want to conduct business with Sally Jewell, they have a better chance getting her to schedule a lengthy hike than a coffee date. \n \n President Obama’s unconventional pick to lead the Interior Department — a former oil engineer and commercial banker who heads the consumer co-op Recreational Equipment Inc. (REI) — represents an effort by the administration to defuse the partisan fight over conservation and energy. \n \n Jewell, who lacks the political experience of previous interior secretaries, will be challenged to rebuild a national consensus over protecting public lands. But friends and colleagues describe her as a pragmatic business leader who could work with both parties and interest groups on all sides. \n \n Many environmentalists and oil and gas industry officials greeted her nomination with cautious optimism Wednesday, saying she could reconnect Americans to their outdoors heritage without stifling drilling and mining operations on land and off shore. \n \n Introducing her at the White House, Obama emphasized that Jewell “has spent the majority of her career outside of Washington, where, I might add, the majority of our interior is located.” \n \n She has proven, he added, that one can reconcile economic growth and environmental protection. \n \n “She knows the link between conservation and good jobs,” Obama said. “She knows that there’s no contradiction between being good stewards of the land and our economic progress; that, in fact, those two things need to go hand in hand.” \n \n Jewell, 56, who has spent most of her life in the Seattle area, is an avid climber and hiker who scaled Antarctica’s highest peak two years ago and has repeatedly climbed Washington state’s Mt. Rainier. Doug Walker, who served on the board of REI with Jewell, said she “walks the talk. . . . Sally is not fooling you here. She really does this stuff.” \n \n Walker, who chairs the board of the Wilderness Society, described Jewell as a “can-do, activist-type manager” who will focus on inspiring Americans to care about public lands. The biggest challenge that conservationists face is “really reconnecting these federal lands to the broad swatch of American people, not just elderly white people,” Walker said. \n \n Jewell has advised Republican and Democratic administrations alike on how to enlist more Americans in outdoor activities, most recently helping chart a plan for the U.S. National Park Service’s future while she served on the National Parks Second Century Commission. \n \n Obama touted his nominee’s experience working for Mobil Oil in the late 1970s and the early ’80s, noting that Jewell was a University of Washington undergraduate studying to be a dentist when she “realized her boyfriend’s homework was more interesting than hers, and she decided to become an engineer” and “went on to work in the oil fields of Oklahoma and Colorado.” \n \n Tim Wigley, president of the Western Energy Alliance, said he hoped that time in the fields would translate into expanded oil and gas drilling on federal lands. “We hope to see a better balance of productive development on non-park, non-wilderness public lands that enhances the wealth of America and creates jobs while protecting the environment,” he said. \n \n 1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Obama’s second term: Who’s in, who’s out?

Here is how the second-term team is shaping up. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. \n \n Jewell also won praise from former interior secretary Dirk Kempthorne, who enlisted her in multiple brainstorming sessions in Shepherdstown, W.Va., when he led the department under President George W. Bush. \n \n “She was always someone I wanted there because she’s a catalyst,” Kempthorne said, adding that he didn’t even know her party affiliation. He said she was well suited to manage Interior’s “vast portfolio,” which includes Indian lands and offshore drilling, “because she is effective and time-tested on taking a variety of issues, deciphering them, determining what is the most important and making a decision.” \n \n A few voices within the Republican Party and the environmental community expressed hesi­ta­tion Wednesday, noting that Jewell’s limited political résumémade it difficult to pass judgment. \n \n Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said she “looked forward to hearing about the qualifications Ms. Jewell has that make her a suitable candidate to run such an important agency and how she plans to restore balance to the Interior Department.” \n \n Bill Snape, senior counsel for the advocacy group Center for Biological Diversity, wrote in an e-mail that he and his colleagues “are hopeful but not yet joining the love fest. She has her work cut out for her and our public lands are not a publicly-traded commodity on Wall Street.” \n \n Outdoor Industry Association President Frank Hugelmeyer said the move shows that the president has recognized the true economic value of outdoor recreation. Hugelmeyer estimated that it generates $646 billion in annual direct consumer spending and 6.1 million direct jobs. \n \n “No one sees it as unusual when a Treasury secretary comes out of the investment banking world,” he said. “I think it’s way overdue.” \n \n If confirmed, Jewell would take over at a time when many conservationists are pressing Obama to take bolder action on land conservation. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar devoted much of his tenure to promoting renewable energy on public land and managing the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. \n \n On Tuesday, former interior secretary Bruce Babbitt gave a speech at the National Press Club in which he called on the president to set aside one acre permanently for conservation for every acre he leases for oil and gas development. \n \n “So far, under President Obama, industry has been winning the race as it obtains more and more land for oil and gas,” Babbitt said. “Over the past four years, the industry has leased more than 6 million acres, compared with only 2.6 million acres permanently protected. In the Obama era, land conservation is again falling behind.” \n \n Fran Ulmer, a former lieutenant governor of Alaska who serves on the board of the National Parks Conservation Association with Jewell, said the nominee was skilled at helping “people get to a common solution” and tended “to take the long view” on public-lands issues. \n \n “She’s going to ask the question, not what’s in the best interest today but what’s in the interest in the long term, and I think that will have implications for energy policy and public-lands management,” Ulmer said, “I’d say in a good way.” \n \n As a member of the University of Washington’s Board of Regents, Jewell is also familiar with navigating difficult budget issues. The university’s president, Michael Young, said that even as board members struggled with a loss of state funding and subsequent tuition increases, “Sally was a remarkably steady voice in steering through that. She’s a great manager: very levelheaded, very clear-eyed, with the capacity to keep her focus on the ultimate goal.” \n \n And Walker said that although Jewell is somewhat wary of entering the political fray, she’s “in essence willing to sacrifice everything” to take on the challenge. \n \n “It’s not like she’s running for something else,” he said. “This is the culmination of what she wants to do.” \n \n At the White House on Wednesday, Jewell joked about the challenge before her. “I’m going to do my best to fill those big boots of yours,” Jewell said to Salazar, prompting a round of laughter, “but I think I might get lost in your hat.” \n \n Eddy J. Palanzo contributed to this report.",
    "summary": "– President Obama will make an unconventional Cabinet pick today, naming REI Equipment Inc. CEO Sally Jewell as his new secretary of the Interior, a source tells the Washington Post. Jewell has had an interesting career path: She started out as an engineer for Mobil Oil, then became a commercial banker, before finally landing her spot at REI. She has little policy experience, though she has occasionally dipped her toe into politics, introducing Obama at the White House's 2011 Great Outdoors Initiative and taking part in Obama's 2009 CEO health care summit. But Jewell isn't a partisan Democrat; she made a high-profile appearance in support of John McCain in 2008. The pick is also unusual, the Post points out, because the Interior secretary position is often reserved for a Western politician. But Jewell would give Obama another woman in his Cabinet, countering critics who complained that his early second-term nominees were all men."

    "document": "Hi-diddly-d’oh! \n \n As you may have read by now, Harry Shearer tweeted last night that he plans to depart The Simpsons after 26 seasons of service. The Emmy-winning Shearer is one of six primary actors on the animated comedy, and his voice has echoed far and wide throughout Springfield, bringing life to such iconic characters as Ned Flanders, Mr. Burns, Smithers, Seymour Skinner, Otto, Dr. Hibbert, Lenny, Reverend Lovejoy, and a bunch more. \n \n Simpsons producers have said that the show—and Shearer’s characters—will continue regardless, as the show received a two-season renewal just last week. “Harry Shearer was offered the same deal the rest of the cast accepted, and passed,” Simpsons executive producer Al Jean said in a statement early this morning. “The show will go on and we wish him well. Maggie took it hard.” \n \n But when EW spoke with Jean later this morning, he was still at least hopeful that Shearer might have a change of heart and sign the same contract that his five other castmates have. What is the producers’ next step? How will Shearer’s exit impact the show? Who might replace him? Will Mr. Burns sound the same the next time we hear him? EW spoke with Simpsons executive producer Al Jean about these burning questions and more. (A rep for Shearer didn’t immediately respond to EW’s request for comment.) \n \n ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: So… what happened? \n \n AL JEAN: Well, we’re still hoping he might come back. Nothing’s done ‘til it’s done. He tweeted that it was over, but… There’s an offer that the rest of the cast accepted, and Harry has not accepted it. It’s not going to change, because the rest of the cast took it. So we’re hoping he does. If he doesn’t within a certain period of time, we would have to recast—but we haven’t started. \n \n What is that period of time? Weeks? \n \n Well, it’s pretty vague because we have seven holdover [episodes] that Harry did in the fall, so there’s a big period of time. Obviously, we just want to know what he wants. We’ve rededicated ourselves this season to making the show better and not just saying, ‘Okay, we’re just happy for the pickup.’ We really care about it, and everybody’s coming to more [table reads] and doing more on the show. So if he’d like to be a part of that, we’d love him. And if not, we’d like to know and then we’ll go another way. \n \n Would you describe yourself as very hopeful that this could be resolved? \n \n I have no idea. I didn’t know he was going to tweet last night. That was very surprising. And the tweets were confusing because he had an offer. It wasn’t like we didn’t offer him a substantial thing. No. 2, he mentioned that he wanted to do outside projects. Everybody on the show does lots of outside projects. He actually gets to record on the phone and do the [table] reads on the phone. So we’ve never kept him from doing that stuff. So that’s one confusion I had. For the last several years, he’s done reads on the phone. He doesn’t always participate. We’ve excused him for several and he records, as long as it’s done in time, when it’s convenient for him. So it’s not a scheduling thing. And he says it’s not a money thing. So I’m not sure what he’s thinking. \n \n When was your first sense that he might be leaning this way? \n \n The other cast signed May 1, and he didn’t—so that was the first time we felt, “Oh, there’s something different with him. He may not sign.” \n \n During the contentious contract negotiation of 2011, he was vocal about fair compensation for the voice actors and volunteered to take a 70-percent pay cut in exchange for some of the back end. Did you sense that factored in here at all? \n \n He said it wasn’t about money, and I don’t think it is either. People always talk about what our cast makes and I think it’s well-known they make a significant amount of money—and good for them. I don’t think anyone in the real world would say that they’re not well-compensated. I really don’t know what the issue is here. That’s what’s confusing. \n \n Are you planning to reach out to him personally? \n \n Yeah, we’re going to try once to say, “What’s going on? We’d like you back.” And if he says, “I don’t want to be back,” in that case, then we would say, “Okay, we’ve got to move on.” We are definitely doing the season. There was an erroneous report that this would affect the pickup. That’s not true. The pickup is a guarantee. The other five [actors] that are signed—we are in production with pay-or-play deals, so we’re going to do 625 episodes. [Note: That’s number of episodes that the show will have made by the end of the latest two-season renewal.] \n \n What was your reaction on an emotional level when you heard that he tweeted that he was leaving? \n \n My reaction is, “Oh, he’ll be back.” It’s not the first time that it’s been a possibility, but he always returns. \n \n Assuming he does leave, how big of a loss is this for the show? \n \n I’d be lying if I said it was no loss. He’s talented and he just won an Emmy for The Simpsons. But I also have to say that I’d be lying if I said he was irreplaceable. I think that he could be replaced, and if need be, will have to be. We’re not going to get rid of the characters. \n \n But you actively and definitely want him back, correct? \n \n Yeah, we’d like him back…. Obviously, if he’s really interested in doing the show and committing like the other five are, as well as Tress MacNeille and Pamela [Hayden], great. He’s really talented. \n \n What does Harry bring to the show that will be hard to replace? \n \n He’s got a great voice and he has a great way of saying things funny. Skinner’s really funny. He’s a terrific voiceover actor. When he won the Emmy, I thought it was long overdue and said so… My two favorite characters that he does are Burns—he’s such a terrific villain—and Flanders, because he’s such a wonderful, sweet counterpoint to Homer. Those are the ones I would certainly be the most careful in replacing. \n \n But I would very careful with all of them. We wouldn’t go, “Oh, let’s hire the first guy that walks in.” I’m sure if it’s the case—if he says, and he did—that he’s through, there’s a ton of people that want to do it. I’m not just saying everybody out on YouTube, I’m saying talented voiceover people… So we’re prepared either way. If he goes, no hard feelings. If he stays, great. \n \n Do you already know who would be replacing him? If not, what is the audition process? And given Harry’s versatility, are we to assume that several actors would fill his different roles? \n \n We’ve talked about it. There’s nobody that’s for sure. We’d probably have several. For example, if we recast Dr. Hibbert, it should be an African-American actor. There are a lot of great African-American voice actors. There’s no reason that all those characters need to be voiced by one person. Also, the person that does the voice could have other funny voices too, which could add to the show. Burns doesn’t have to be front and center in every episode. We’ve had three really good reads without Harry being on the show. It’s not like we’re sitting there going, “Oh, this a disaster.” We’re moving. We’re doing it. \n \n And you have your eyes on certain people already? \n \n There are certain people that suggest themselves immediately. But again, we’re not putting out a casting call this week. I mean, he just announced that he’s quitting. It’s not like we had no inkling, but again to show you that we weren’t just trying to get rid of him, we were waiting for the situation to settle before we even did something like put out [feelers] to recast. We asked him to come back, he didn’t say yes, we gave him a little grace period, and if he’s really not coming back and says so, then we have no choice. \n \n Are some of his characters in those episodes? \n \n Yeah, they are. So either we’ll get him or we’ll replace him with somebody. \n \n Do you think viewers would be able to tell a big difference in the voice of the characters? \n \n My true feeling is that we have seven holdover shows with Harry, and then there’s shows that don’t have Harry’s characters as much so that by the time, should he leave, that the changes were effective…I think it will be a great show, and I don’t think it will be a big issue. We always had problems when people said, “You’re going from ink and paint to digital coloring to high def.” And people said, “You can’t survive the loss of the characters that Phil Hartman did.” And that was very sad. So, yeah, I think it will be a challenge but not fatal…. We’re hoping for him to come back. It’s not over, but the show will continue regardless. ||||| For 25 years he's been the voice of Ned Flanders, Mr Burns, Waylon Smithers, and countless other characters on The Simpsons. \n \n Now after a contract dispute, it seems Harry Shearer could leave, saying he wants \"the freedom to do other work\". \n \n The hit animation's executive producer, Al Jean, tweeted the parts will be \"recast if Harry does not return\". \n \n Newsbeat's auditioned a man who could replace Shearer - 23-year-old Sean Burke. \n \n \"I can do about 20 Simpsons voices, I suppose.\" \n \n Sean told Newsbeat that he struggles with female characters - and had trouble getting his Marge voice right. \n \n \"Homer is actually the most difficult. I had to practise in an empty house, because my early attempts were hilariously bad.\" \n \n No disrespect to Harry Shearer, but Sean thinks that the characters the star voices are amongst the easiest to imitate. \n \n \"Mr Burns is pretty easy. You just have to try to sound like Stewie Griffin from Family Guy.\" \n \n For comparison, we put Sean up against Newsbeat listeners Adam, from Leeds, and Jeremy, from Reading, to see who had it what it takes to join one of the world's biggest cartoons. \n \n There was only one clear winner. \n \n After his clear success at Newsbeat's interview stage, Sean told us what he thought of a Simpsons without Harry Shearer. \n \n \"I haven't actually been watching the Simpsons for years now, I'd say that's the case for a lot of people. \n \n \"I mean series one to 10 was the real sweet spot for the Simpsons, so I think it's already had its golden years.\" \n \n Not really the kind of noises you want to be making if you want the job, Sean. \n \n \"I think maybe, it's the beginning of the end, because Harry plays 10 to 15 characters. And main ones too.\" \n \n Despite all of that, Sean wouldn't have to think twice about taking the job. \n \n \"Absolutely! I'm still not going to say no to that now. I'm available!\" \n \n Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter, BBCNewsbeat on Instagram, Radio1Newsbeat on YouTube and you can now follow BBC_Newsbeat on Snapchat",

    "document": "The average age in Congress is 58. Newly elected Representative Elise Stefanik, 30, beats that by almost half. Meet the youngest woman ever to join Congress. \n \n Something unusual happened when U.S. Representative Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) went to freshman orientation in what would become her new office building: She got stopped by Capitol Hill police—they didn't think the ponytailed 30-year-old looked like a member of Congress. \n \n But while Stefanik may be young, she's not green: She first ran for student council in sixth grade; her platform was getting a new snack machine installed, and she won. Four days after graduating from Harvard, she landed a coveted job as an assistant in President George W. Bush's administration. What she learned there led her to help write the 2012 Republican party platform—at just age 28—and prep Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) for the vice presidential debates. \n \n So who from the Bush White House or the GOP convinced her to run? No one. Elise Stefanik just raised her hand. \"I was so disappointed by the 2012 election that I decided I had to do something,\" she says. \"And I thought, I have something to offer—I should be able to have a seat at the table.\" (Yes, Sheryl Sandberg was an influence: \"I read Lean In at a really important time as I was deciding to run for office,\" Stefanik says.) She started planning her own campaign, talking to her parents and boyfriend of three years, then to her mentors. \"When I first told Congressman Ryan I was thinking of running, his advice was this: 'You have one mouth and two ears. Use them in that ratio.'\" To do that she traveled more than 100,000 miles through her upstate New York district, much of it in her Ford F-150 truck—often alone, sometimes stranded by snowstorms—to meet voters and hear their concerns. Along the way there were plenty of naysayers. \"People said, 'You're too young. You're not married. You don't have kids.' They even [criticized] my crazy-pattern tights!\" she says. \"But you do your homework. I know the issues, and I worked hard and built relationships.\" \n \n \"It's incredibly historic to organize a campaign at such an early age; what Elise Stefanik did is like pushing a boulder uphill. We'll see a lot of her in the years to come.\" \n \n —Norah O'Donnell, cohost of CBS This Morning \n \n It paid off. In the first six weeks of her candidacy, Stefanik raised $180,000. On Election Day she won by 22 points. Her GOP positions would please many party traditionalists—she wants to repeal Obamacare and reform the tax code, and has landed a coveted spot on the Armed Services Committee—but she considers young upstart tech companies like Uber the best model for how government could be faster, more transparent, and more accountable. (She's also promised to post every single vote she makes on Facebook.) And she's pledged to reach across the aisle, in part because she knows Washington gridlock is a turnoff both for voters and for other young women considering a run. \"My hope is that my example will get other women to step up to the plate,\" Stefanik says. \"Things won't change unless we have new types of candidates.\" \n \n How will she handle this next phase of her career? Probably by logging the hours. One of Stefanik's role models is her father, who started the family's plywood company and usually arrives at his office before 6:00 A.M. \"My dad always said, 'Don't tell me how smart you are; tell me how hard you work,'\" she says. \"What I've also learned is that the harder you work, the smarter you become.\" \n \n HER WORDS TO LIVE BY: \"Luck favors the brave.... Many people would say, 'She got lucky.' But I believe that it was [my] early courage to enter the race that was the key factor in winning.\" ||||| New York Republican Elise Stefanik, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, may have gone to college with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, but it's Facebook's COO, Sheryl Sandberg, whom she cites as a major influence on her decision to run for office. Stefanik praised Sandberg's best-selling book, \"Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead,\" and said she hopes her own example inspires more women to \"step up to the plate\" to run for office, as she prepares to be sworn into office on Tuesday. \n \n In an interview with \"CBS This Morning\" Anchor Norah O'Donnell, Stefanik described Sandberg's best-seller as \"very important to my formulating my decision...to run for office.\" The 30-year old Harvard graduate, a rising star in the Republican party, said Sandberg's book resonated with her, as a young professional woman. Sometimes, she said, women like her \"hold themselves back from not seeking the next professional step, whether it's a promotion or whether it's running for office.\" \n \n Sandberg's affiliation with Democrats didn't make a difference to Stefanik. The former Bush White House staffer and aide to 2012 Vice Presidential candidate Paul Ryan says she's ready to \"bring compromise back\" to Washington by \"building relationships across the aisle.\" \n \n In November, Stefanik easily defeated Democrat Aaron Woolf, 55 percent to 34 percent, in a contested district which went for President Obama in 2012 and had been held by retiring Democratic Rep. Bill Owens since 2009. Despite her commanding victory in the end, it was a bruising race for the native New Yorker. \"I was rowing the boat alone against a tide, running against an incumbent in 2013,\" she said, before Congressman Owens announced his retirement in January 2014. Stefanik said the negative ads about her were hard for her family to watch, but she would simply tell them, \"It's okay, I have a thick skin.\" \n \n The incoming 114th Congress will have a record 104 women when it convenes on Tuesday. Stefanik would like to see even more women in Congress and considers herself a role model for young girls and other women. \"I hope to encourage more women to step up to the plate and regardless of their political affiliation or for their views.

    "summary": "– Among the newcomers to DC this year is Elise Stefanik, a Republican from upstate New York who made history last fall by becoming the youngest woman elected to Congress. How young? Glamour begins a profile by noting that Capitol Hill police stopped her as she arrived for freshman orientation—\"they didn't think the ponytailed 30-year-old looked like a member of Congress.\" But the profile and a separate interview with CBS News make clear that Stefanik is not exactly a political novice. She landed a job in the Bush administration right out of Harvard, and went on to lead Paul Ryan's debate-prep team when he ran as Mitt Romney's VP candidate. In both pieces, Stefanik credits Sheryl Sandberg's book Lean In with giving her the courage to launch a congressional bid at the age of 29. Then came months of driving her Ford pickup all over her district to meet voters and win over skeptics. \"People said, 'You're too young. You're not married. You don't have kids,'\" she recalls. \"But you do your homework. I know the issues.\" One of her goals—in addition to repealing ObamaCare and reforming the tax code—is to improve the GOP's image with women and to draw more young women in general into politics. \"Things won't change unless we have new types of candidates.\""

    "document": "When I first heard that John Henry Browne was writing a book about his life, and in particular his association with Ted Bundy, I knew it was a book I would order as soon as it was available. I anticipated it would be a very good book and I was not disappointed. Whatever one thinks of Browne's political beliefs or his thinking on progressive issues, The Devil's Defender is an enjoyable and very informative read. I must also say that I found it extremely interesting as he delved into what Ted Bundy told him about the murders, including Bundy's confession of an alleged murder of a boy when Ted was just a boy himself. Is such an allegation true? Perhaps not. But what matters here is that (according to Browne) Bundy confessed it, and as such, the author was right to add it to the book. \n \n \n \n Now, there are a couple of things I'd like to address: \n \n \n \n When Browne speaks of his life and those things he experienced while dealing with Bundy, he's telling the reader what he absolutely knows to be true, and as such, it all appears to be flawless. However, there are some egregious (and avoidable) errors that have crept into the book that should be corrected for future editions. While I will not name them all, I will give two examples that should especially stand out to readers who are familiar with the Bundy case: In at least three places Browne states that Bundy was arrested in Lake City, Florida (where he killed his last victim, 12 year-old Kim Leach), when of course, Bundy escaped Lake City unmolested by authorities, only to be arrested in Pensacola, Florida days later. Also, he states in at least two places that when Bundy was abducting Carol DaRonch from the Fashion Place Mall in Murray, Utah (Bundy was posing as a police officer), that Ted used the name officer \"Rosebud\" when in fact, Bundy was calling himself officer Roseland. And it's these types of mistakes (and as I said above, there are others) that needlessly hinder the book. \n \n \n \n All in all, however, we can all be thankful that Browne has written about his interactions with America's most infamous serial killer, as it certainly adds to the overall picture of his crimes. ||||| Seattle attorney John Henry Browne says he’ll hire Colton Harris-Moore, the infamous ‘Barefoot Bandit,’ to work part time in his law office \n \n The former fugitive who became known to the world as the “Barefoot Bandit” is about to be released from prison and will take a part-time job with the Seattle attorney who represented him in court. \n \n John Henry Browne, a high-profile attorney whose clients have also included serial killer Ted Bundy, confirmed Wednesday that Colton Harris-Moore, 25, will do clerical work and answer telephones in his Pioneer Square offices after he’s released from prison to a halfway house. \n \n “He’ll be looking for full-time work and will eventually be going to school,” Browne said. \n \n According to Browne’s recently published autobiography, “The Devil’s Defender,” the attorney said he took Harris-Moore’s defense for $1 paid by Harris-Moore’s mother. \n \n Browne negotiated a plea agreement that sent Harris-Moore to prison for six and a half years, but has resolved dozens of federal and state charges pending against him since his escape from a juvenile halfway house in 2008. \n \n By the time he was arrested in 2010 after a boat chase in the Bahamas, Harris-Moore was something of a folk hero, with a huge following on social media and articles of his exploits in major national publications. \n \n Browne also helped Harris-Moore work out a movie deal that resulted in a Hollywood studio coming up with more than $1 million to pay restitution that Harris-Moore owed for wrecking cars, crash-landing three stolen airplanes and dozens of thefts and burglaries. Harris-Moore has received no money from the deal, Browne said Wednesday. \n \n Browne said the job offer was part of a deal he had made with Harris-Moore years ago. \n \n Harris-Moore’s formal release date from Stafford Creek Correctional Center in Aberdeen is Jan. 17, according to the state Department of Corrections. Browne said he was being moved to a halfway house as early as this week. \n \n According to court records, Harris-Moore turned to crime as a child out of hunger and neglect from his alcoholic and abusive mother. Pamela Kohler, of Camano Island, died of cancer earlier this year even as Harris-Moore, from prison, desperately tried to raise money to have her cryogenically frozen with the hope she could be cured of cancer later. \n \n Browne said the death was hard on Harris-Moore, but “in some ways I think it was a relief and has freed him.” \n \n Harris-Moore was first jailed as a 17-year-old, and was serving time for burglary at a juvenile halfway house when he escaped in 2008. For the next two years, he evaded capture while committing a string of break-ins and thefts, often leaving a telltale sketched bare footprint at the scene as a signature. \n \n During much of that time, the gangly youth hid out in the forests of Orcas Island in the San Juans and squatted in the attic of a plane hangar at the island’s airport. Eventually, he flew a stolen plane from Indiana to the Bahamas, where he was captured. \n \n The internet made Harris-Moore a cult hero, and at one time he had nearly 50,000 followers on his Facebook page, where he would occasionally leave a post written on a stolen laptop. \n \n He eluded a massive manhunt, and police warned that he was dangerous. Among his crimes were the thefts and interstate transportation of at least two stolen handguns, and police say he took an assault rifle from a police car. \n \n Harris-Moore said he taught himself how to fly using flight manuals and a computer flight simulator, according to court documents. \n \n While he was able to get the three planes off the ground and pilot them, sometimes in bad weather, he had a tougher time with the landings: Harris-Moore crashed all three, acknowledging in defense documents that he nearly died in a September 2009 crash of a stolen Cessna that went down near Granite Falls in Snohomish County. \n \n At his sentencing, Harris-Moore told U.S. District Judge Richard Jones his dream of flying was the only thing that saved him from the nightmare of his childhood. \n \n Browne, the attorney, said Harris-Moore has been befriended by a Boeing engineer and wants to be an aeronautical engineer. \n \n Browne says he’s been repeatedly impressed by Harris-Moore’s desire to improve himself. \n \n “Indeed, Colton, one of my favorite clients today, truly is a triumph,” Browne wrote in his book. ||||| SEATTLE - Colton Harris-Moore could be released from prison any day now, and when he is, he'll have a job. \n \n \n \n Harris-Moore, who earned his nickname of \"Barefoot Bandit\" because he left his footprints at the scenes of his crimes, many on Camano Island, is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence handed down in 2012 when he was 19. But his defense attorney, John Henry Browne, says Harris-Moore has served enough time that he could be set free from prison into work release at any time. \n \n \"They don't tell you in advance,\" Browne told KOMO News. \"They just come to your cell and say pack your things, you are out of here.\" \n \n The storied Seattle lawyer confirms that he offered, \"with mixed-emotions\" at first, the chance for the teen-turned-young-man an opportunity to intern in his law office. \n \n \"He's matured a lot,\" Browne says of Harris-Moore, adding his client is being mentored by a \"fantastic\" Boeing engineer. \n \n After committing several crimes across northern Washington, Harris-Moore somehow, without any training, stole and piloted aircraft across the country. He crashed one outside of Granite Falls, and walked away, evading capture for some time after that. Eventually he stole cars to drive across country, committing similar theft-type crimes along the way, until he stole another plane in Indiana and flew to the Bahamas. There, he was arrested after a wild boat chase. \n \n Harris-Moore's story is that of a broken childhood. In and out of trouble, diagnosed with several psychiatric disorders, he made his break for freedom while serving a 3 year sentence in a halfway house in south King County- punishment for stealing a camcorder. From there, the teen lived in the wild. A few sightings here and there, and those footprints the only signs of the Barefoot Bandit. \n \n His fixation with airplanes, and lack of formal training was a recipe for disaster. Browne calls him, \"A walking miracle.\" \n \n In what Browne called the, \"plea bargain of a lifetime,\" Moore at 19 was sentenced to more than 7 years in prison in a deal that consolidated most of the some 100 charges against him. \n \n And when he gets out of jail, he has a place to live, and a job. \n \n \"He's ahead of the game than most released,\" Browne said. \n \n That knock on Moore's cell door could come at any time, Browne says, and the Barefoot Bandit will begin the next phase of his life. ||||| Story highlights It is unclear on what date he will be released, his attorney says \n \n Once he is out of state prison, Colton Harris-Moore has job with his lawyer's firm \n \n (CNN) The man known as the \"Barefoot Bandit,\" who gained a large Facebook following and snagged a movie deal after a fugitive crime spree across nine states and three countries, is about to be released from state prison, his attorney said Wednesday. \n \n Colton Harris-Moore became infamous when he spent two years robbing homes and stealing boats, cars and planes, often while wearing no shoes. \n \n He was captured in 2010 after crashing a stolen plane in the Bahamas and then trying to escape in a stolen boat. \n \n Seattle attorney John Henry Browne said he doesn't have the exact date his client will be released from the Stafford Creek Corrections Center in Washington state, but told CNN he will give Harris-Moore a clerical job at his law firm. \n \n Browne told the Seattle Times that Harris-Moore will work part-time and live at a halfway house. \n \n Read More",

And Colton Harris-Moore, 25, already has a job lined up. His lawyer, John Henry Browne, says Harris-Moore will \"be looking for full-time work and will eventually be going to school,\" but in the meantime, he'll have a part-time job doing clerical work and answering phones at Browne's Seattle office, the Seattle Times reports.

Harris-Moore also has a place to live, and is more \"ahead of the game than most released,\" Browne adds.

Harris-Moore became \"something of a folk hero,\" the Times notes; he was a hungry and neglected child when he first turned to a life of crime and was first sent to jail for burglary at age 17. He escaped from a halfway house in 2008 and eluded authorities while committing break-ins and thefts for two years, even stealing boats, cars, and planes. His nickname comes from the sketch of bare footprints he'd leave behind as a signature (and the fact that he was often barefoot while committing his crimes, CNN notes). He was caught in the Bahamas after he flew a stolen plane there. A movie deal will help Harris-Moore repay his victims. (Click for more of the Barefoot Bandit's fascinating story.)"

    "document": "Methods: We conducted a cohort study of 1636 women from two prospective breast cancer cohorts. Intrinsic tumor subtype (luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]–enriched, basal-like) was determined by the PAM50 gene expression assay. Breastfeeding history was obtained from participant questionnaires. Questionnaires and medical record reviews documented 383 recurrences and 290 breast cancer deaths during a median follow-up of nine years. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between breastfeeding and tumor subtype. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for breast cancer recurrence or death. Statistical significance tests were two-sided. \n \n Results: Breast cancer patients with basal-like tumors were less likely to have previously breastfed than those with luminal A tumors (OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.39 to 0.80). Among all patients, ever breastfeeding was associated with decreased risk of recurrence (HR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.53 to 0.93), especially breastfeeding for six months or more (HR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.46 to 0.87, P trend = .01). Similar associations were observed for breast cancer death. Among women with luminal A subtype, ever breastfeeding was associated with decreased risks of recurrence (HR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.31 to 0.89) and breast cancer death (HR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.29 to 0.93), yet no statistically significant associations were observed among the other subtypes. Effects appeared to be limited to tumors with lower expression of proliferation genes. ||||| By Kathleen Doheny \n \n HealthDay Reporter \n \n TUESDAY, April 28, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Women who breast-feed their babies and later develop breast cancer are less likely to have the cancer return or to die from it than women who do not breast-feed, new research shows. \n \n \"We found in this study of over 1,600 women with breast cancer that those who previously breast-fed had a 30 percent overall decreased risk of their breast cancer recurring,\" said study leader Marilyn Kwan, a research scientist at the Kaiser Permanente division of research in Oakland, Calif. \"We also found those who previously breast-fed had a 28 percent reduced risk of dying from their breast cancer.\" \n \n The study was published online April 28 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. \n \n Previous research has found that breast-feeding is linked with a lower risk of developing breast cancer in the first place, the researchers said. \n \n \"If a woman breast-feeds, she reduces her risk of developing breast cancer by about 5 percent to 10 percent, although other factors come into play,\" Kwan said, such as the number of children she has had. \"We think this is one of the first [studies] to examine the role of breast-feeding and breast cancer outcomes -- prognosis and survival,\" she added. \n \n \"Overall, our study confirms that breast-feeding is not only good for the baby, but has potential health benefits for the mom,\" Kwan said. \n \n Her team found that breast-feeding's protective effect in lowering the chances of recurrence or death from breast cancer was strongest against the most commonly diagnosed breast cancers. \n \n The study builds on previous evidence about the link between breast-feeding and breast cancer, said Dr. Joanne Mortimer, director of Women's Cancer Programs and co-director of the Breast Cancer Program at City of Hope Cancer Center, in Duarte, Calif. \n \n The message that's reinforced in the new research, Mortimer explained, is that ''women who breast-feed get less aggressive breast cancer.\" While that has been known, the new study adds detailed findings about tumor types, she said. \n \n Kwan's team looked at two groups of women, some diagnosed from 1997 to 2000 and others diagnosed from 2006 to 2013. Most were patients at Kaiser Permanente, a large health maintenance organization. \n \n The researchers found an association between breast-feeding and a more favorable outcome for breast cancer patients, but the study didn't prove cause-and-effect. The investigators found the link to be statistically significant with breast cancers known as luminal A subtypes, including tumors known as estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive), the most common of all breast cancers. However, they did not find the link to be statistically strong for other subtypes of breast cancer. \n \n While Kwan found an overall 30 percent reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence among those who breast-fed, when they took the length of breast-feeding into account, any duration decreased risk, but the link was not as strong for those who did so for less than six months. \n \n The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusive breast-feeding for about six months, followed by continued breast-feeding as foods are introduced, for up to a year or longer. Breast-feeding helps protect babies from diseases such as diabetes, from infection and from becoming overweight. Mothers who breast-feed have a lower risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, according to the AAP. \n \n Kwan and others speculate that breast-feeding may be protective for a number of reasons. For instance, it reduces a woman's lifetime number of menstrual cycles, and that lowers the accumulated exposure to hormones that can help some cancers grow. Breast-feeding also increases differentiation, or maturation, of the ductal cells in the breast, perhaps making them more resistant to cancer, Kwan explained. \n \n Mortimer said that possible mechanism makes sense, based on a concept that the breast isn't fully developed until a woman has lactated. \n \n More information \n \n To learn more about breast-feeding, visit the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",

Everything I did is entirely my fault, I am so sorry.” \n \n AKB48, a 90-strong pool of girls in their teens and early 20s, is a money-printing juggernaut that makes much of the accessibility — and the implied availability — of its idols. \n \n Fans have frequent opportunities to meet their favorites, who are rotated in and out of the public eye, according to popularity. \n \n In return for their chance to grace television screens, subway adverts and the covers of Japan’s countless celebrity magazines, members of the collective must adhere to strict rules of behavior. \n \n They are allowed to have “one-sided romantic feelings” for a boy but can never progress beyond hinting at their crush — and must never disabuse their legions of male fans that they might one day stand a chance with their fantasy woman. \n \n In June last year, another AKB48 member, Rino Sashihara, 20, made a pained apology after a magazine article revealed her free-wheeling history with a boy. She was demoted to a regional sub-group as a punishment. \n \n While much is made of their supposed innocence, the band is heavily marketed on its sex appeal, with skimpy outfits and coquettish smiles the order of the day. \n \n A television commercial in which the girls seductively passed candy from mouth to mouth was a huge hit, despite — or because — of its homoerotic overtones, which sparked complaints from more conservative sections of society. \n \n Most recently, a photograph that showed naked former AKB48 member Tomomi Kasai with a young, apparently Caucasian or Eurasian child cupping her breasts, set off police probe and led to the pulping of about 670,000 copies of a popular weekly magazine. \n \n Watch the video, published to YouTube on Jan. 31. ||||| As pop star misdemeanours go, Minami Minegishi's was tame in the extreme – breaking her group's strict dating ban to spend a night with her boyfriend. \n \n Yet hours after a magazine published photographs of her leaving his home last month, Minegishi, a member of the wildly popular girl band AKB48, went on to YouTube to issue a tearful apology. \n \n \"As a senior member of the group, it is my responsibility to be a role model for younger members,\" she said, before ending the four-minute mea culpa with a deep, lingering bow. \n \n The most striking thing about her apology, however, was her appearance. She had shaved her head, a traditional act of contrition in Japan, but perhaps a step too far for a 20-year-old woman whose \"crime\" was to have found herself a boyfriend – 19-year-old Alan Shirahama, a dancer in a boyband. \n \n Minegishi explained she had decided to cut off her long hair immediately after seeing her photograph, her face hidden behind a surgical mask and a baseball cap, in the weekly tabloid Shukan Bunshun on Thursday. \n \n Her dramatic gesture underlined the strict rules to which Japan's young pop stars must adhere to project an image of unimpeachable morals. \n \n In the YouTube video, which has been viewed more than 3m times, Minegishi said the assignation has been \"thoughtless and immature\". \n \n \"If it is possible, I wish from the bottom of my heart to stay in the band,\" she said. \"Everything I did is entirely my fault. I am so sorry. \n \n \"I don't believe just doing this means I can be forgiven for what I did, but the first thing I thought was that I don't want to quit AKB48.\" \n \n AKB48's management agency demoted her to \"trainee level\" starting on Friday, according to the band's official blog. \n \n Minegishi is among the original members of the band, which since it formed in 2005 has built up a huge following among teenage girls and salarymen who flock to concerts and publicity events for the chance to shake hands with their idols. \n \n The group, named after the geeky Akihabara district of Tokyo, has had a succession of million-selling singles and generated sales of more than £126m in CD and DVD sales in 2011. \n \n Together, the AKB48 stable has more than 230 members in their teens and early 20s, with four main bands and several offshoots. Their act is more saccharine than sexual, but the band has courted controversy off-stage in the past year. \n \n In 2012, a TV commercial in which the girls seductively passed confectionery from mouth to mouth attracted complaints, and earlier the same year one of the singer's mothers was arrested for allegedly having sex with a minor. \n \n Last month, police launched an investigation after a weekly magazine ran a photo of a young boy cupping the breasts of the former AKB48 member Tomomi Kasai. The publisher was forced to destroy about 670,000 copies of the magazine.",

The first \"Independence Day\" opened with $50.2 million, or about $77 million in inflation-adjusted dollars. \n \n Of the week's other debuts, the Blake Lively shark thriller \"The Shallows\" rode a wave of good reviews to a better-than-expected $16.7 million for Sony. \n \n Matthew McConaughey's Civil War drama \"Free State of Jones,\" however, disappointed with just $7.7 million, a blow to the upstart studio STX Entertainment. ||||| Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Ellen DeGeneres & Ed O'Neill talk about Dory's new grumpy ‘septopus’ sidekick Hank in the movie ‘Finding Dory.’ USA TODAY \n \n 'Finding Dory' tops the box office for a second weekend. (Photo: Pixar) \n \n Finding Dory is the big kahuna of the summer box office. \n \n Disney/Pixar's animated sequel just kept swimming into its second weekend, harpooning $73.2 million and dipping just 46%, according to studio estimates from comScore. In only 10 days, the Finding Nemo follow-up has hooked $286.6 million in the USA and $396.9 million worldwide. \n \n \"I'm not surprised that it did this well,\" says comScore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian. \"It's been a go-to movie for everyone, and that's the magic of the Pixar brand. Having a Pixar movie in the summer mix is always good for business.\" \n \n Dory, which arrives 13 years after the Oscar-winning Nemo, has stayed afloat thanks to glowing reviews (94% positive on aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes) and reactions from moviegoers (90% liked it). The movie follows regal blue tang fish Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) as she searches for her parents (Eugene Levy and Diane Keaton), and features new and returning voice talent including Ed O'Neill, Albert Brooks and Idris Elba. \n \n Dory's titanic second weekend was enough to capsize Independence Day: Resurgence, which sank with $41.6 million for No. 2. The $165 million movie, a sequel to 1996 alien apocalypse blockbuster Independence Day starring Will Smith, was met with abysmal reactions from critics (33% positive reviews) and moviegoers (40% liked it). \n \n In third place, action comedy Central Intelligence steathily pocketed $18.4 million in its second weekend. The CIA caper starring Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and Kevin Hart has earned $69.3 million in 10 days — trailing Johnson's surprise hit San Andreas last summer (which made $98.5 million in two weeks), but coming in higher than Hart's Ride Along 2 ($58.6 million in two weeks) earlier this year. \n \n Shark-attack thriller The Shallows made a splash its first week out, chomping off $16.7 million for No. 4. The modestly budgeted popcorn movie starring Blake Lively baited critics (74% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences alike (69% liked it). \n \n Drawing strong word of mouth and social media chatter, \"This is what every studio executive dreams of,\" Dergarabedian says. \"Sort of like a shark, this movie came out of nowhere and surprised everyone.\" \n \n Rounding out the top five, Free State of Jones grinds the \"McConaissance\" to a halt. The poorly reviewed Civil War drama starring Matthew McConaughey brought in just $7.8 million, although it earned an encouraging A- from moviegoers at CinemaScore (the best of any new openers). \n \n On just three screens in New York and Los Angeles, offbeat buddy comedy Swiss Army Man took $114,000, giving it the best per-screen average of the summer with $38,000. The Sundance Film Festival breakout, which stars Daniel Radcliffe as a farting corpse, expands nationwide next week. \n \n In wider release, writer/director Nicolas Winding Refn's fashion-world horror film The Neon Demon stumbled with only $607,000 on 783 screens. \n \n Final numbers are expected Monday. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/28UiEBZ",

That puts the Finding Nemo sequel at nearly $400 million in 10 days. \"I'm not surprised that it did this well,\" a comScore analyst tells USA Today. \"It's been a go-to movie for everyone and that's the magic of the Pixar brand.\" That far surpassed the $41.6 million opening of Resurgence, which debuted well off the pace off its 1996 original. The first Independence Day opened with $50.2 million, or about $77 million in inflation-adjusted dollars. Of the week's other debuts, the Blake Lively shark thriller The Shallows rode a wave of good reviews to a better-than-expected $16.7 million for Sony. Matthew McConaughey's Civil War drama Free State of Jones, however, disappointed with just $7.7 million, a blow to the upstart studio STX Entertainment."

(AP Photo/Julio Cortez) (Associated Press) \n \n Here's a look at how Americans are celebrating: \n \n ___ \n \n A MACY'S THANKSGIVING DAY SUCCESS \n \n Oohing and ahhing spectators of all ages lined the route of the nationally televised Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, which counted Thomas the Tank Engine, Paddington bear and the Red Mighty Morphin Power Ranger among its six new giant balloons. \n \n It was around 37 degrees with a hint of drizzle and light winds as clowns shot a burst of confetti from canisters to get the show rolling. \n \n \"This is great. It's nice to feel so festive for the holidays,\" said paradegoer Daryl Winchester, 17, of Queens, as she took pictures, waved and shouted encouragement to parade participants. \n \n Steve Smith, a clown of 12 years performing in the parade, said he loves to make children happy. \n \n \"The kids, they are the ones who make the parade,\" he said. \n \n ___ \n \n HOW THE FIRST FAMILY IS CELEBRATING \n \n President Barack Obama is spending a quiet Thanksgiving at the White House where the belly-stuffing menu featured all the holiday's basics. \n \n There's thyme-roasted turkey and honey-baked ham, cornbread stuffing and oyster stuffing, braised winter greens and macaroni and cheese. Don't forget the green bean casserole, sweet potato gratin, mashed potatoes and dinner rolls. \n \n If there's room for dessert, the Obamas can pick from among six pies: banana cream, coconut cream, pumpkin, apple, pecan and cherry. \n \n Obama says Thanksgiving is his favorite holiday \"because, more than any other, it is uniquely American.\" \n \n ___ \n \n FERGUSON PROTESTS NEAR PARADE \n \n About six protesters chanting \"Justice for Mike Brown!\" were handcuffed Thursday after they tried to march toward the parade route, the New York Post reported. The New York Police Department told The Associated Press there were seven arrests near the parade but didn't immediately provide details. \n \n Near the end of the parade route, about 50 protesters walked down the sidewalk carrying signs and chanting, \"Hands up, don't shoot.\" \n \n \"We will not tolerate, under any circumstances, any effort to disrupt this parade,\" police Commissioner William Bratton said earlier Thursday. \"This is a national event, a historic event. Anybody who would seek to interrupt it would be callous, indeed, on this very special day.\" \n \n Protests in New York have remained peaceful since a grand jury's decision not to indict the police officer who killed the unarmed Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. \n \n ___ \n \n IN THE DARK \n \n Power outages from the first major snowstorm of the season could force some residents of the Northeast to celebrate Thanksgiving much like the pilgrims and Native Americans did almost 400 years ago — in the dark. \n \n The outages on Thursday were particularly bad in northern New England, where more than 200,000 customers were without power in New Hampshire and more than 100,000 were without electricity in Maine. \n \n In Vermont, Mike Mrowicki was in the middle of baking squash and making apple-cranberry crisp Wednesday night when the lights flickered off. Mrowicki said they'll improvise on their meal for 10 people. \n \n \"We've got a gas stove, and we've got a woodstove we heat with,\" explained Mrowicki, a state representative from Putney. \"We've got plenty of lanterns and candles.\" \n \n The rain and snow that fell Wednesday made getting around on one of the busiest travel days of the year a chaotic experience for some. The sloppy mixture grounded hundreds of flights in the Northeast. \n \n ___ \n \n HOLIDAY SHOPPING \n \n To the delight of some and consternation of others, it's increasingly become commonplace to see stores open on Thanksgiving, as retailers try to entice shoppers inside and kick off the holiday shopping season a day earlier than the traditional Black Friday. Some of the stores open for at least part of the day on the holiday include Kmart, Target, Sears, Macy's and Wal-Mart. Other stores, like Neiman-Marcus, Nordstrom and Costco, are closed. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Dave Gram contributed to this report from Montpelier, Vermont. ||||| Protesters demonstrating against the Missouri grand jury's decision not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson tried to disrupt the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade — but you would never know it watching NBC's live broadcast of the festivities. \n \n #StoptheParade trended on Twitter Thursday, as protesters rallied at the annual parade in New York City. Just after it began at 9 a.m. ET, New York police arrested some protesters who tried to enter the parade path, while chanting and carrying signs. \n \n NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton said Thursday morning police were ready for protests. \n \n “We’ll be prepared for that, and let’s hope they’re smart enough and courteous enough not to engage in that activity,” Bratton told WCBS 880. \n \n “We’re monitoring it very closely, and I’m anticipating a very good day, a very peaceful day.\" \n \n Protesters were scattered after the arrests, so organizers coordinated on Twitter, telling participants to regroup at the New York Public Library. \n \n Regroup back at the library #stoptheparade — Katastrophe (@nevernotever) November 27, 2014 \n \n After some arrests (between 4 and 7), #StopTheParade is regrouping at the New York Public Library — JAPSPEPORJ FENWAY (@SidizenKane) November 27, 2014 \n \n Thousands of people took to New York City's streets Tuesday night, and many onlookers, including motorists, showed their support while demonstrators passed by. However, public sentiment did not appear to be in favor of protesters at the parade. \n \n Some guy watching the #NYC #Thanksgiving parade angrily told us while we were chanting \"I've got my kid here!\" #MikeBrown #Ferguson — Ash J (@AshAgony) November 27, 2014 \n \n Tuesday's protesters poured into Manhattan's Union Square on Tuesday to show their support for 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was shot and killed by Wilson in August. \n \n Protesters have faced little opposition from the New York Police Department, as they blocked roads, bridges and highways in the city. Only 10 protesters were arrested Tuesday, police said. \n \n If you expect to see the #StoptheParade protests on television, you'll be disappointed. Still, demonstrators are continuing to post photos of their efforts, using the hashtag. \n \n More well wishes from #NYPD at #stoptheparade.

    "summary": "– As New York celebrated at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade today, protesters over events in Ferguson, Mo., gathered at the scene—but it seems they didn't make much headway, nor did they make it into NBC's telecast, Mashable reports. Several chanting protesters were reportedly arrested when they tried to get into the parade's path. Afterward, organizers told the group to meet back at the New York Public Library, where demonstrations continued. Meanwhile, the parade was a success despite drizzly, 37-degree weather, the AP reports. The event featured six enormous new balloons, including Paddington Bear, Thomas the Tank Engine, and a Power Ranger."

    "document": "As Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio ramps up his search for new hires, the rumor mill is spinning with names in the running for plum administration posts. \n \n According to conversations Politicker’s had with a wide range of insiders, names being bandied about include City Council members, advocates, and even an actress from Sex and the City. \n \n While Mr. de Blasio has yet to name a full transition team, members of his inner circle are engaged in back-channel conversations with candidates Mr. de Blasio would like to hire. At the same time, various interest groups have been testing the waters, throwing out names they’d like to see on the incoming team, which is likely to include a mix of existing staffers, experienced government pros and the kind of well-seasoned D.C. operatives who helped run his campaign. \n \n The team has also been reaching out to staff at the public advocate’s office, asking what they’d like to do in the new administration. “They’re trying to take care of everybody,” one source said. \n \n Below is a list of some of the names we’ve been hearing. \n \n Top Advisers: Mr. de Blasio is likely to keep his inner circle close as he begins the most important job of his career, according to observers. This notably includes Emma Wolfe, the former Working Families Party organizer who joined Mr. de Blasio in 2009 to help run his campaign for public advocate and went on to become his chief of staff and deputy mayoral campaign manager. \n \n Dominic Williams, his current chief of staff, is likely in the running for something as well. \n \n Carol O’Cleireacain, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, who served as the city’s former New York City budget director and finance commissioner under Mayor David Dinkins has been mentioned as a possible budget director. \n \n Another name being floated for budget director or deputy mayor for operations is Anthony Shorris, currently a senior vice president at New York University’s Langone medical center. Mr. Shorris has a wealth of government experience; he previously served as the executive director of the Port Authority, the city’s finance commissioner and deputy budget director. \n \n Former Port Authority chief Chris Ward has also been floated for deputy mayor of operations, according to Crain’s New York Business and NY1. \n \n But there are also dozens of other positions fill, from press aides to top commissioners: \n \n Press: Wiley Norvell, the public advocate’s press secretary, is expected by some to move to the mayor’s office–a much larger operation than Mr. de Blasio’s current government shop. He could be joined by Phil Walzak, Mr. de Blasio’s campaign’s senior communications advisor, who has experience working for everyone from President Obama to the Department of Homeland Security, and potentially other press aides who have been working with him in recent months. \n \n Police: Thus far, the talk of whom Mr. de Blasio will choose as the next police commissioner and next schools chancellor have dominated the headlines, with three main names put forward to run 1 Police Plaza: former Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, Chief of Department Philip Banks III and First Deputy Police Commissioner Rafael Pineiro. Mr. Pineiro has been making a public case for his candidacy as the first Hispanic police chief. \n \n Education: The schools list is even longer, with names including former Baltimore schools chief Andres Alonso, state Board of Regents member Kathleen Cashin, Carmen Farina, who worked with Mr. de Blasio when he served on a Park Slope school board, and the current chief academic officer, Shael Polakow-Suransky. \n \n Housing: There has been some speculation that Mr. de Blasio, the former regional head of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, will want to shake up the Department of Housing Preservation and Development–potentially putting it under the same umbrella as other building agencies to achieve one of his central election promises: Add or preserve 200,000 units of affordable housing over the next eight years. \n \n Among the names that have been discussed as contenders, according to the Wall Street Journal, are Adam Weinstein, the president and CEO of the nonprofit Phipps Houses and Shola Olatoye, the vice president of Enterprise Community Partners, an affordable housing organization. Crain’s included Michelle de la Uz, executive director of the Fifth Avenue Committee to their list. \n \n Culture: Several interesting names are being floated to head up the Department of Cultural Affairs, including Cynthia Nixon, the former Sex and the City star who was one of Mr. de Blasio’s earliest and most vocal campaign supporters. Another name that has come up: Randall Bourscheidt, the president of the Alliance for the Arts, who served as deputy commissioner of cultural affairs for New York City in the 1980s. \n \n Pat Kaufman, who currently serves as executive director at New York State Governor’s Office for Motion Picture and Television Development, is considered a prime choice to replace Katherine Oliver at the Mayor’s Office of Film, Theatre & Broadcasting. While Mr. de Blasio has praised Ms. Oliver in the past–he recently told The Observer that,“If there was one commissioner I’d like to keep if I was elected mayor, it’d be Commissioner Oliver”–sources expect her to step down at the end of the year. \n \n Transportation: The Journal suggested that Mr. de Blasio might be inclined to replace Transportation Commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan with another high-ranking member in the department. Among the names they floated: First Deputy Commissioner Lori Ardito and Manhattan Borough Commissioner Margaret Forgione. \n \n Parks: Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz has been proposed for the post of parks commissioner, according to Fox 5. Another unlikely name rumored to be seeking the post: State Senator Daniel Squadron, who recently lost his bid for public advocate. A spokeswoman for Mr. Squadron said it was the first she’d heard of any such rumor. \n \n Fire and Sanitation: While Mr. de Blasio has made it clear he wants to largely clean house, it’s not unusual for some to remain on the job. Sanitation Commissioner John Doherty, one of the city’s longest-serving appointees, is reportedly looking to stay on, as is Fire Commissioner Sal Cassano. “In the FDNY, we have a great team, so let’s see what happens with the new administration,” he recently told NY1. \n \n Other posts: \n \n Democratic State Senator Liz Krueger, one of Mr. de Blasio’s early supporters, has been repeatedly floated as a potential candidate for his administration. According to the New York Post‘s Page 6, she has already been tapped to serve as first deputy mayor or deputy mayor for health and human services–but her spokesman has denied the reports. “Sen. Krueger has neither discussed nor asked for a position in the new administration,” he recently told Politicker. \n \n Brooklyn City Councilman Brad Lander, the co-chair of the progressive caucus who has emerged as a dominant force on the council, is being talked about as a potential cabinet member–perhaps deputy mayor for economic development. The councilman did not respond to a request for comment. \n \n Gladys Carrión, the current commissioner of the New York State Office of Children and Family Services has been floated as a potential deputy mayor for health and human services. \n \n Peter Madonia, the current chief operating officer of the Rockefeller Foundation, previously served as chief of staff to Mayor Michael Bloomberg after serving as senior adviser to his campaign for mayor, who has reportedly been serving as a close adviser (along with former Clinton aide Harold Ickes and John Banks III) is expected to be considered for a top slot. \n \n And Justin Brannan, a Democratic organizer, animal rights activist and communications director for Brooklyn Councilman Vinnie Gentile, has been floated to oversee animal welfare legislation. \n \n ||||| She helped get Bill de Blasio elected mayor, often clocking more than 40 hours a week as a volunteer months before most New Yorkers thought he had a serious shot at City Hall. \n \n Now Christine Marinoni — the wife of “Sex and the City” actress Cynthia Nixon — is ready to organize for another uphill battle. \n \n Marinoni, 46, wants to mobilize fired-up supporters to help pass de Blasio’s signature campaign promise: a tax hike on the wealthy to pay for universal pre-K. \n \n Christine Marinoni (left) with Bill de Blasio and his wife, Chirlane McCray. \n \n “That's what people are talking about,\" said Marinoni, founder of the “Women for de Blasio” group, over lunch at the Happy Days Diner in Brooklyn. \n \n “We've got a Women's Committee list just shy of 1,000 people that wants to get working on it already,” she said. “It's a big organizing committee — and that's just one of the constituency groups that has been galvanized.” \n \n Cynthia Nixon at a Bill de Blasio campaign event on Feb. 28 for local bloggers.

Being a parent has made her even more fervent about universal pre-K. \n \n \"If you're a parent with means, you're going to find a place to put your child,” she said. “If I did not have means, I would be in a panic, quite frankly.” \n \n During the campaign, Marinoni helped recruit stars like Chris Noth, Russell Simmons and Alan Cumming for cameos in a campaign ad. “I'm definitely more of an organizer, but don't get me wrong, it's fun to hang out in celebrity world,” she said of her dual life. “It's really a source of power to be able to mobilize people with name recognition.\" \n \n De Blasio credits Marinoni with building an early base of support. \n \n “Christine is an organizer's organizer,” de Blasio said in a statement. \n \n Sign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails privacy policy Thanks for subscribing!",

    "document": "New Haven and state officials load human remains into a truck for forensic examination, July 15, 2015. (WTNH) \n \n \n \n \n \n NEW HAVEN, Conn. (WTNH) — New Haven police confirm that they have located the remains of human legs near the train tracks at the corner of State and Court Streets, and an arm along the tracks near Chapel Street. \n \n Just after 11:20 a.m., police responded to the area near the State Street Train Station on a report of human remains found, and found legs. Police say at about 7 p.m., investigators found a plastic bag that appears to contain at least one human arm. \n \n “A rookie patrol officer who had a traffic point at the crime scene was alerted by someone who said that they had walked by the area of Union Street and Chapel Street, and for quite some time had smelled what seemed to be a rotting smell,” said New Haven Police Department public information officer David Hartman. He says there’s no certainty the arm and legs are related. \n \n Witnesses say the legs were found between State Street itself and the train tracks in some bushes. In those bushes is a chain link fence to prevent people and animals from getting down to the train tracks. Near that fence is where the bottom part of two human legs were found, startling Pablo Rivera and his friend on Monday. \n \n “He started screaming, ‘hey, come here, I think I found something, two human legs, come here, I want to make sure it is real,'” Rivera said. \n \n He alerted police on Monday, but officials couldn’t find anything. \n \n “The officers called it in. They had the fire department respond as well,” said Hartman. “I don’t know what tools were used, but if you didn’t know what you were looking for and you didn’t have someone there to point out where they were talking about, it would be almost a futile search.” \n \n Rivera went back to the police with pictures on Wednesday. \n \n “I come here today and still there the legs,” he said. “I had take the picture and I go to the police again and showed the picture.” \n \n The New Haven Major Crimes Division spent the day combing the area collecting evidence and taking pictures. As of 4:45 p.m., the legs were removed from the scene, bagged, and taken by the State Medical Examiner’s office for forensic testing. Investigators don’t know the gender or race or age of the of the victim. \n \n “These legs have been here or at least in their condition for some time; I’m told over a week,” said Hartman. \n \n The police department will now rely on the expertise of the Medical Examiner’s office. Police say this case needs to be looked at beyond the border of New Haven. \n \n “We have to involve investigators and especially missing persons investigators from other jurisdictions as well,” Hartman said. \n \n Investigators remain in the area. Police say forensic investigators have requested that death investigators from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner return to the scene. They say state police will also bring in a cadaver dog. ||||| New Haven police investigate the discovery of human legs found near the State Street railroad station near Court Street in New Haven Wednesday. Peter Hvizdak — New Haven Register \n \n NEW HAVEN >> A homeless man led police to the beginning of a grisly mystery Wednesday morning: A pair of severed human legs hidden in thick vegetation near the State Street train station. \n \n Hours later, at about 7 p.m., a few blocks down the road from where the legs were found, police made another gruesome discovery: A human arm in a plastic bag. The arm was found on a ledge below the Chapel Street Bridge near Union Avenue after a person noted a foul smell in the area and notified authorities. \n \n While there were far more questions than answers after police held two press conferences Wednesday, police spokesman Officer David Hartman said during the latter of the two that police eliminated the possibility of the parts being the result of an accident. \n \n “We don’t think that this was a train accident, certainly not at this point, certainly not with the arm, which was in a plastic bag,” Hartman said. \n \n Advertisement \n \n What’s more, until there is a forensic evaluation, police cannot determine whether the body parts are from the same person, let alone the gender, race or age of the victim. \n \n “We are kind of in a waiting game,” Hartman said. “We are trying to narrow down who this victim may be — or victims.” \n \n Detectives continued their search of the area Wednesday evening for other body parts and evidence. Hartman said it was unclear whether the area would be cordoned off throughout the night, and said the investigation is ongoing. \n \n Police did not theorize how the legs got to where they were found. They haven’t taken anyone into custody for questioning, Hartman said. He said that it’s even possible that the limbs may be part of a crime from another city or even state. \n \n “This is our investigation,” Hartman said. “This is not necessarily a crime that occurred in New Haven. It could very well be a secondary and now a third extended crime scene of something that happened.” \n \n Hartman said the legs looked as though they’d been severed for some time — at least a week — given their condition, but it wasn’t clear whether the legs necessarily had been there for the same duration. There were socks on, but no shoes. Police did not find blood or blood residue at the scene, which Hartman said suggests dismemberment did not occur at the site at which the legs were found. \n \n Hartman said police are working with the state office of the chief medical examiner to identify the body parts. Detectives will be looking into disappearances and reports of missing persons from the area. \n \n Court Street was shut down at State Street while police investigated shortly after noon. The entire east side of State Street was shut down to traffic; it continued to be closed between Court Street and Chapel Street until at least 10 p.m. \n \n State police brought in cadaver dogs Wednesday evening to search the area, but found nothing. \n \n Pablo Rivera of New Haven said at the scene Wednesday that he and a friend reported their discovery of the legs to New Haven police Tuesday but said he thinks they did not believe him. \n \n Rivera said he saw the legs had socks on the feet but no shoes. \n \n Michael Fumiatti of Madison said he commutes on Shore Line East and smelled something strange Monday. \n \n “You got to wonder what happened down here. Was it a train accident or was it something else nefarious that went on?” Fumiatti said. \n \n Hartman said police were told about the legs by a citizen Monday, but said the person didn’t stick around to show officers where the legs were. Police searched the area Monday but did not find anything. Hartman stressed how difficult the legs were to find in the brush. He also mentioned that there are homeless encampments in the area and that people find shelter under the trees. \n \n Meredith Daniels, a spokeswoman with Metro-North, said in a phone interview Wednesday that the human parts are unrelated to any incident involving Metro-North trains. \n \n Along with the medical examiner’s office, New Haven police worked with Amtrak and Metropolitan Transportation Authority police. The NHPD would work with other departments if evidence points to the legs coming from elsewhere. \n \n Reporter Ed Stannard contributed to this story.",
    "summary": "– A police search around railroad tracks in New Haven, Conn., has yielded two legs, one arm, no head, no torso, and a lot of questions. A homeless man led police to the area where the severed legs were found in thick vegetation yesterday, and the arm was later found on a ledge under a bridge a few blocks away, the New Haven Register reports. Police say they don't know the race, age, or gender of the victim—or even if the limbs are all from the same person—but they are reasonably sure this wasn't a train accident, especially since the arm was in a bag. Investigators suspect the remains could be from a crime in another jurisdiction and are checking missing-person reports from other areas, WTNH reports."

She’ll address the media at Boeing’s welcome center in North Charleston at noon and participate in a separate economic development announcement in the city in the afternoon, according to her public schedule. ||||| Nikki Haley is one of the most unpopular Governors in the country. Only 42% of voters approve of the job she's doing to 49% who disapprove. Out of 43 sitting Governors PPP has polled on, that ranks her 35th in popularity. \n \n Haley has pretty solid numbers within her own party. 70% of Republicans approve of the job she's doing to 22% who disapprove. But with Democrats (15/78 approval) and independents (28/57) her numbers are pretty woeful. \n \n There is a path back to popularity for Haley though: appointing Stephen Colbert to replace Jim DeMint in the Senate. Colbert tops the wish list of who South Carolina voters would like to see join that body at 20%, followed by Tim Scott at 15%, Trey Gowdy at 14%, Jenny Sanford at 11%, Henry McMaster and Mark Sanford at 8%, Jeff Duncan and Joe Wilson at 5%, and Mick Mulvaney at 4%. \n \n It's Democrats and independents- those voters Haley most needs to improve her standing with- who are pining for a Colbert appointment. Among Democrats 32% say they'd like Colbert to be picked with Jenny Sanford at 19% and no one else in double digits. With crucial independent voters Colbert has a 15 point lead for the appointment, getting 28% to 13% for Tim Scott, 12% for Jenny Sanford, and 10% for Trey Gowdy with no one else in double digits. \n \n If Colbert's lacking knowledge of the state beverage keeps him from Haley's consideration, voters say their top choice is Jenny Sanford at 17%, followed by Tim Scott at 16%, Henry McMaster at 13%, Trey Gowdy at 12%, Mark Sanford at 9%, Joe Wilson at 7%, Jeff Duncan at 6%, and Mick Mulvaney at 5%. Sanford becomes the first choice of both Democrats and independents without Colbert in the mix and is particularly strong with women, 24% of whom think she should receive the appointment. \n \n If you further filter the field and take the Sanfords out of the potential appointment list three men really stand out from the field: Tim Scott at 19%, Henry McMaster at 17%, and Trey Gowdy at 15%. The other three Congressmen we tested end up well back- Joe Wilson at 8%, Mick Mulvaney at 7%, and Jeff Duncan at 6%. \n \n In all three permutations of the field we tested Tim Scott comes out as the top choice among Republicans. It's 22/21 over Gowdy with Mark Sanford at 11% when Colbert and both the Sanfords are included. It's 23/19 over Gowdy with McMaster and M. Sanford both at 11% when Colbert's taken out. And it's 25/21 over Gowdy with McMaster at 15%, Wilson at 12%, and Mulvaney at 11% when the Sanfords are taken out. \n \n Others notes from this poll:",
    "summary": "– Gov. Nikki Haley may not be into the idea, but her fellow South Carolinians really want to see Stephen Colbert replace Jim DeMint in the Senate. A Public Policy Poll finds that 20% of voters have the Comedy Central host at the top of their wish list, followed by Tim Scott (15%), Trey Gowdy (14%), and Jenny Sanford (11%). Mark Sanford even made it on 8% of the wish lists, even though just 30% of voters have a good opinion of him two years after he left office. But 44% of voters like Jenny Sanford, and if Colbert really is out of the running, she tops the DeMint replacement wish lists at 17%. Haley may want to reconsider her stance on Colbert, since choosing him could boost her popularity—right now her approval rating is just 42%, making her one of the country's least popular governors. But so far, the only clue she's given as to whom she'll appoint is that it won't be a \"placeholder\" who agrees not to run for re-election, Politico reports. In a statement today, Haley said she doesn't want to undermine the effectiveness of DeMint's replacement, and thinks the state \"will be best served by a US Senator who will work hard day in and day out.\" That could signal Scott as her likely choice, Politico notes."

    "document": "The total cost to America of its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, plus the related military operations in Pakistan, is set to exceed $4 trillion – more than three times the sum so far authorised by Congress in the decade since the 9/11 attacks. \n \n Click HERE to view graphic (101 kb) \n \n This staggering sum emerges from a new study by academics at the Ivy-league Brown University that reveals the $1.3 trillion officially appropriated on Capitol Hill is the tip of a spending iceberg. If other Pentagon outlays, interest payments on money borrowed to finance the wars, and the $400bn estimated to have been spent on the domestic \"war on terror\", the total cost is already somewhere between $2.3 and $2.7 trillion. \n \n And even though the wars are now winding down, add in future military spending and above all the cost of looking after veterans, disabled and otherwise and the total bill will be somewhere between $3.7 trillion and $4.4 trillion. \n \n The report by Brown's Watson Institute for International Studies is not the first time such astronomical figures have been cited; a 2008 study co-authored by the Harvard economist Linda Bilmes and Joseph Stiglitz, a former Nobel economics laureate, reckoned the wars would end up costing over $3 trillion. The difference is that America's financial position has worsened considerably in the meantime, with a brutal recession and a federal budget deficit running at some $1.5 trillion annually, while healthcare and social security spending is set to soar as the population ages and the baby boomer generation enters retirement. \n \n Unlike most of America's previous conflicts moreover, Iraq and Afghanistan have been financed almost entirely by borrowed money that sooner or later must be repaid. \n \n The human misery is commensurate. The report concludes that in all, between 225,000 and 258,000 people have died as a result of the wars. Of that total, US soldiers killed on the battlefield represent a small fraction, some 6,100. The civilian death toll in Iraq is put at 125,000 (rather less than some other estimates) and at up to 14,000 in Afghanistan. For Pakistan, no reliable calculation can be made. \n \n Even these figures however only scratch the surface of the suffering, in terms of people injured and maimed, or those who have died from malnutrition or lack of treatment. \"When the fighting stops, the indirect dying continues,\" Neta Crawford, a co-director of the Brown study, said. Not least, the wars may have created some 7.8 million refugees, roughly equal to the population of Scotland and Wales. \n \n What America achieved by such outlays is also more than questionable. Two brutal regimes, those of the Taliban and Saddam Hussein, have been overturned while al-Qa'ida, the terrorist group that carried out 9/11, by all accounts has been largely destroyed - but in neither Iraq nor Afghanistan is democracy exactly flourishing, while the biggest winner from the Iraq war has been America's arch-foe Iran. \n \n Osama bin Laden and his henchmen probably spent the pittance of just $500,000 on organising the September 2001 attacks, which killed 3,000 people and directly cost the US economy an estimated $50bn to $100bn. In 2003, President George W Bush proclaimed that the Iraq war would cost $50bn to $60bn. Governments that go to war invariably underestimate the cost – but rarely on such an epic scale. \n \n If the Brown study is correct, the wars that flowed from 9/11 will not only have been the longest in US history. At $4 trillion and counting, their combined cost is approaching that of the Second World War, put at some $4.1 trillion in today's prices by the Congressional Budget Office. ||||| NEW YORK When President Barack Obama cited cost as a reason to bring troops home from Afghanistan, he referred to a $1 trillion price tag for America's wars. \n \n Staggering as it is, that figure grossly underestimates the total cost of wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan to the U.S. Treasury and ignores more imposing costs yet to come, according to a study released on Wednesday. \n \n The final bill will run at least $3.7 trillion and could reach as high as $4.4 trillion, according to the research project \"Costs of War\" by Brown University's Watson Institute for International Studies. (www.costsofwar.org) \n \n In the 10 years since U.S. troops went into Afghanistan to root out the al Qaeda leaders behind the September 11, 2001, attacks, spending on the conflicts totaled $2.3 trillion to $2.7 trillion. \n \n Those numbers will continue to soar when considering often overlooked costs such as long-term obligations to wounded veterans and projected war spending from 2012 through 2020. The estimates do not include at least $1 trillion more in interest payments coming due and many billions more in expenses that cannot be counted, according to the study. \n \n The White House says the total amount appropriated for war-related activities of the Department of Defense, intelligence and State Department since 2001 is about $1.3 trillion, and that would rise to nearly $1.4 trillion in 2012. \n \n Researchers with the Watson Institute say that type of accounting is common but too narrow to measure the real costs. \n \n In human terms, 224,000 to 258,000 people have died directly from warfare, including 125,000 civilians in Iraq. Many more have died indirectly, from the loss of clean drinking water, healthcare, and nutrition. An additional 365,000 have been wounded and 7.8 million people -- equal to the combined population of Connecticut and Kentucky -- have been displaced. \n \n \"Costs of War\" brought together more than 20 academics to uncover the expense of war in lives and dollars, a daunting task given the inconsistent recording of lives lost and what the report called opaque and sloppy accounting by the U.S. Congress and the Pentagon. \n \n The report underlines the extent to which war will continue to stretch the U.S. federal budget, which is already on an unsustainable course due to an aging American population and skyrocketing healthcare costs. \n \n It also raises the question of what the United States gained from its multitrillion-dollar investment. \n \n \"I hope that when we look back, whenever this ends, something very good has come out of it,\" Senator Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, told Reuters in Washington. \n \n SEPT 11, 2001: THE DAMAGE CONTINUES \n \n In one sense, the report measures the cost of 9/11, the American shorthand for the events of September 11, 2001. Nineteen hijackers plus other al Qaeda plotters spent an estimated $400,000 to $500,000 on the plane attacks that killed 2,995 people and caused $50 billion to $100 billion in economic damages. \n \n What followed were three wars in which $50 billion amounts to a rounding error. For every person killed on September 11, another 73 have been killed since. \n \n Was it worth it? That is a question many people want answered, said Catherine Lutz, head of the anthropology department at Brown and co-director of the study. \n \n \"We decided we needed to do this kind of rigorous assessment of what it cost to make those choices to go to war,\" she said. \"Politicians, we assumed, were not going to do that kind of assessment.\" \n \n The report arrives as Congress debates how to cut a U.S. deficit projected at $1.4 trillion this year, roughly a 10th of which can be attributed to direct war spending. \n \n What did the United States gain for its trillions? \n \n Strategically, the results for the United States are mixed. Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein are dead, but Iraq and Afghanistan are far from stable democracies. Iran has gained influence in the Gulf and the Taliban, though ousted from government, remain a viable military force in Afghanistan. \n \n \"The United States has been extremely successful in protecting the homeland,\" said George Friedman, founder of STRATFOR, a U.S.-based intelligence company. \n \n \"Al Qaeda in Afghanistan was capable of mounting very sophisticated, complex, operations on an intercontinental basis. That organization with that capability has not only been substantially reduced, it seems to have been shattered,\" Friedman said. \n \n Economically, the results are also mixed. War spending may be adding half a percentage point a year to growth in the gross domestic product but that has been more than offset by the negative effects of deficit spending, the report concludes. ||||| Amid a growing debate over how to bring down the government’s debt, a new study has concluded that U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan has cost up to $4 trillion over the past decade. \n \n The study, by the nonpartisan Eisenhower Research Project based at Brown University’s Watson Institute for International Studies, also estimates that at least 225,000 people, including civilians, troops and insurgents, have died as a result of the conflicts. Of that number, an estimated 6,000 were uniformed U.S. military personnel. \n \n Pentagon spending accounts for only half of the budgetary costs incurred and represents a fraction of the full economic cost of the wars, according to the study. Among other line items, the study’s contributors — more than 20 economists, political scientists and other experts — estimate federal obligations to care for past and future veterans will eventually total $600 billion to $950 billion. \n \n The estimates are based on reports from the Congressional Budget Office, the Congressional Research Service and myriad other sources. \n \n The $4 trillion estimate could be fodder for lawmakers increasingly concerned that the United States can ill-afford to maintain a large military presence in Afghanistan. \n \n The study’s authors say that’s a debate worth having. \n \n “Some people will say that’s an expensive price tag, but what we’re trying to do makes it worth it. Other people will say we can’t afford it,” Catherine Lutz, co-director of the “Costs of War” project, said in an interview. “That’s the debate.” \n \n Lutz said the group began its research about a year ago, but that it’s fortunate that the findings are being released in the midst of a major debate about government spending. \n \n It “makes no sense” to have that debate without solid data, she said.",
    "summary": "– The real cost of American military action in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan dwarfs the $1.3 trillion appropriated on Capitol Hill, according to a study by Brown University's nonpartisan Eisenhower Research Project. The study estimates that the war bills already paid or obligated to be paid are at least $3.2 trillion and probably closer to $4 trillion, with the bulk of the spending buried in a variety of budgets and invisible to taxpayers, reports Reuters. \"Some people will say that's an expensive price tag, but (that) what we're trying to do makes it worth it,\" the co-director of the project tells the Washington Post. \"Other people will say we can't afford it. That's the debate.\" The combined cost of the wars—including obligations to future veterans and interest already paid on money borrowed to finance the wars—is approaching the cost of World War II, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates was $4.1 trillion in today's prices, the Independent reports."

A reenactment of the movie Flight done entirely with sock puppets. And a whole lot of jokes that skirted along—and sometimes right over—the edge of bad taste. Love it or hate it, Seth MacFarlane’s turn as Oscar host will definitely be talked about—which is almost certainly what the Academy was banking on when they hired the man behind Family Guy for the job. Here are some of the highlights and low blows. Check back for updates throughout the show. \n \n “Welcome to the Oscars.

In fact, studio accountants have never had to work harder to prove nothing made a profit.” \n \n “This is going to be a big night for some of you people, because, as we all know, winning an Oscar guarantees a long, successful career in the industry. Look at last year: Jean Dujardin won best actor for The Artist and now he’s everywhere! I’m kidding, of course. His is actually a tragic, age-old Hollywood story: he couldn’t make it in the talkies.” \n \n “It’s a big night for foreign films. Amour is nominated–or as I call it, This is 90.” \n \n “Daniel Day-Lewis, your process fascinates me. You were totally 100% in character as Lincoln during the making of the movie… So when you saw a cell phone, would you have to go,’Oh my God, what’s that?!’ If you bumped into Don Cheadle on the studio lot, did you try to free him? How deep did your method go?” \n \n “Django Unchained. This is the story of a man fighting to get back his woman, who’s been subjected to unthinkable violence–or as Chris Brown and Rihanna call it, ‘a date movie.’ … A lot of controversies over the use of the n-word in the film.

    "document": "Here are the quarterly growth rates for the U.S. economy since President Barack Obama took office in January 2009. Growth is measured by the change in gross domestic product, the nation's total output of goods and services. Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009, during the Great Recession, which officially ended in June 2009. ||||| The U.S. economy looks set to weather the headwinds from Hurricane Sandy and the budget battles in Washington after picking up speed in the third quarter. \n \n Gross domestic product probably increased at about a 2.9 percent annual rate in July-September, according to economists from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays Plc. That would be the fastest quarterly growth this year, beating the Commerce Department’s initial estimate of 2 percent. \n \n “The economy’s momentum has picked up a bit” as the fundamentals of the private sector “are improving,” said Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs in New York. He projects third-quarter expansion will be revised up to 2.8 percent, and the fourth quarter may come in at 1.7 percent. \n \n Help is coming from a housing recovery, strengthening job market and healthier household finances that are driving gains in consumer confidence and spending. While the damage from Sandy and an anticipated tightening of fiscal policy mean growth will decelerate this quarter and next, the world’s largest economy may emerge on stronger footing in the second half of 2013. \n \n The Bloomberg Economic Surprise Index, which compares 38 U.S. indicators with analysts’ forecasts, exceeded zero in mid- October for the first time since May and was 0.04 on Nov. 16, up from this year’s low of minus 0.4 on July 30. The projected upward revision to third-quarter GDP, due from the Commerce Department Nov. 29, will come largely from a narrower trade deficit and a bigger jump in stockpiles than initially estimated, economists said. \n \n ‘Heartening’ Signs \n \n While the inventory-accumulation data “don’t have much carry-forward signal in them,” consumer spending in the last few months has been “heartening,” Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told reporters Nov. 15 in Charleston, West Virginia. “That is a positive for growth.” \n \n One immediate restraint is the fallout from the largest Atlantic storm ever to hit the U.S. Retail sales fell in October for the first time in four months as the hurricane hurt receipts at some stores. The 0.3 percent drop followed a 1.3 percent gain in September that was larger than previously reported. \n \n Sandy may trim as much as 0.5 percentage point from fourth- quarter GDP, according to Hatzius, while Dean Maki, chief U.S. economist for Barclays in New York, projects a “downside risk” of as much as 0.3 point. \n \n Fiscal Cliff \n \n A bigger concern is more than $600 billion of tax increases and government spending cuts slated for the start of 2013 unless Congress acts. Maki projects about $200 billion of fiscal tightening; under these circumstances, “solid momentum” entering the final quarter of the year would give the U.S. enough of a cushion to sustain growth. \n \n “It doesn’t make us invulnerable,” he said. “But it’s better than if the economy had already been slowing sharply and then we were hit with these types of events.” His growth forecasts include 2.9 percent for the third quarter and 2.5 percent for the fourth, followed by 1.5 percent in the first three months of 2013 and a pickup to 2 percent for April-June. \n \n Concern over the budget showdown between President Barack Obama and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has helped push the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index down 4.8 percent since Obama’s Nov. 6 re-election. \n \n Better times may be ahead for the stock market as the economy is showing “a pickup, a broadening out, a firing on more cylinders,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist in Minneapolis for Wells Capital Management, which oversees about $325 billion. Shares of American manufacturers and basic-materials producers are most likely to benefit as growth strengthens, he said. \n \n Rising Shares \n \n The S&P 500 Industrials index, which includes General Electric Co. (GE) and Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), is up 5.3 percent this year, while the S&P 500 Materials index (S5MATR), with Alcoa Inc. (AA) and Dow Chemical Co. (DOW), has risen 3.6 percent. \n \n Better-than-projected economic growth has broad implications, ranging from a continuing decline in the unemployment rate to higher company earnings than the market predicts, according to Paul Zemsky, the New York-based head of asset allocation for ING Investment Management. The S&P 500 could end 2012 in the 1,400 to 1,425 range, compared with 1,359.88 at 4 p.m. on Nov. 16 in New York, and appreciate as much as 10 percent next year, he said. \n \n Fully Invested \n \n “The economy is somewhat stronger than people are giving it credit for,” said Zemsky, who helps oversee $170 billion. Once the fiscal clouds clear, “there will be plenty of opportunities for the market to run up” so “we’re definitely keeping some powder dry.” \n \n For now, some investors are seeking safety in bonds as the year-end deadline for fiscal tightening approaches. Yields on 10-year Treasuries fell to 1.58 percent on Nov. 16 from 1.68 percent on Nov. 5. \n \n “The fiscal cliff is being priced in because it’s the biggest risk facing the market right now,” said Priya Misra, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. “Without the cliff, we would grow 2 to 2.25 percent” next year. \n \n In the interim, some areas of the economy continue to improve. Housing -- the industry that helped trigger the last recession -- has turned the corner as borrowing costs near a record low are driving demand. Combined sales of new and existing dwellings climbed to a 5.1 million annual pace in September, up 40 percent from an all-time low in July 2010. \n \n Healing Path \n \n Home Depot Inc. (HD), the largest U.S. home-improvement retailer, posted third-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates, reflecting “the start of the path toward the healing of the housing market,” Chief Executive Officer Frank Blake said in a Nov. 13 statement. \n \n Consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy, accelerated to a 2 percent annual rate last quarter and has reason to keep growing. The jobless rate has fallen 1 percentage point from a year ago to 7.9 percent in October, payrolls are growing faster than forecast, and Americans are turning more upbeat. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index climbed last week to a seven-month high. \n \n The annual pace of U.S. expansion probably will reach “the good old standard” of 3 percent within three or four years, Stanley Fischer, Bank of Israel governor and a former No. 2 at the International Monetary Fund, said in a Nov. 14 interview in Jerusalem. \n \n ‘Underlying Strength’ \n \n Third-quarter GDP growth near 3 percent “makes us more confident” the economy can tackle any headwinds around the turn of the year, said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in New York. It indicates “the labor market’s underlying strength is firmer than we thought,” he said, and “the unemployment rate may fall faster than people think.” \n \n As the holiday-shopping seasons begins, Hasbro Inc. (HAS)’s retail customers are “cautiously optimistic,” David Hargreaves, chief operating officer of the Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based toymaker, said during an Oct. 22 call with analysts. “Certainly consumer demand has held up pretty well.” \n \n In contrast, business sentiment is stagnating as the lack of clarity on taxes and government spending pushes companies into a wait-and-see mode on investment. Still, some pent-up demand may be building as orders are postponed, based on comments from company executives. \n \n Rapid Improvement \n \n “We’ve seen people speak explicitly about not placing orders until they see how things come out here at year-end,” Alexander Cutler, chief executive officer of Eaton Corp. (ETN), a Cleveland-based maker of industrial equipment, said Oct. 31 on a teleconference with analysts. In the event of a bipartisan agreement on the fiscal cliff, “business confidence will improve fairly rapidly.” \n \n The fallout from Sandy also will abate. Reconstruction work could add as much as 0.75 percentage point to GDP in the first quarter of 2013, according to Goldman Sachs’ Hatzius. General Motors Co. (GM) and Ford Motor Co. said auto sales probably will rebound this month on deferred purchases and replacement demand. The hit to the labor market, reflected in jobless claims jumping in the week ended Nov. 10 to the highest since April 2011, may unwind in the next few weeks, economists said. \n \n Even so, employment is far from robust. The jobless rate exceeded 8 percent for 43 months through August, the longest since 1948. It still may be between 7 percent and 8 percent by the end of next year, Fed officials projected in September. \n \n More Stimulus \n \n Policy makers aren’t ruling out more stimulus for the economy just yet. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s last meeting showed a number of officials believe the central bank may need to expand its monthly purchases of bonds next year after the expiration of Operation Twist, a program to extend the maturities of assets on its balance sheet. \n \n For the Fed, “the recent data will likely be viewed as positive but not enough,” Barclays’ Maki said. The FOMC “has a high bar before they’ll acknowledge that growth and the labor market are improving in the way that they would like.” \n \n Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts, is among analysts who remain cautious for now. An upward revision to GDP for July-September would continue “a pattern over the last few years with some extremely poor quarters and some quarters that are much better,” he said. “The fourth quarter looks soft,” though “conditions are in place for accelerating growth” over the longer term. \n \n James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, is more optimistic. He predicts the economy will expand 3.5 percent next year, up from close to 2 percent in 2012, and unemployment will fall to 7.2 percent by the end of 2013. \n \n “Housing in particular has had a better year,” and Europe’s debt crisis “is in a pause mode here for the past several months,” Bullard told reporters Nov. 8 after a speech in St. Louis. “The headwinds we have been facing have been lessening gradually over time.” \n \n To contact the reporters on this story: Shobhana Chandra in Washington at schandra1@bloomberg.net; Steve Matthews in Atlanta at smatthews@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editor responsible for this story: Chris Wellisz at cwellisz@bloomberg.net",
    "summary": "– The US gross domestic product appears to have actually grown at a 2.9% annual rate between July and September, the fastest quarterly growth seen this year. That rate, via analysts at Goldman Sachs and Barclays, is higher than the Commerce Department's initial estimate of 2.0%—and it suggests the economy will take Hurricane Sandy's damage in stride. Improving housing and job markets, as well as better household finances, are spurring consumer confidence and spending, Bloomberg notes. The growth \"doesn’t make us invulnerable,\" notes a Barclays executive. \"But it’s better than if the economy had already been slowing sharply and then we were hit\" with events like Sandy. The hurricane could cut half a percentage point from fourth-quarter GDP, says the Goldman exec, and the fiscal cliff also poses a threat. But with \"solid momentum\" going into the fourth quarter, the US economy should be able to keep growing, says the Barclays economist. \"The economy is somewhat stronger than people are giving it credit for,\" notes an ING director. Any upward revision to Q3 GDP will be reported on Nov. 29."

    "document": "SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — The meteoric rise of Netflix Inc. has led many analysts and industry figures to call the online video-rental business a “momentum story.” But on Thursday, Netflix cut its quarterly subscriber forecast, leading those already skeptical about the company to say its momentum has faltered. \n \n Reuters Netflix CEO Reed Hastings in June, before the company announced price increases that resulted in fewer-than-expected subscribers for the third quarter. \n \n Before the market opened, Netflix NFLX, -0.05% reduced its U.S. subscriber forecasts for the third quarter. The company now expects to end the quarter with 24 million total subscribers in the United States, down from an earlier estimate of 25 million. \n \n Netflix also lowered its estimates on video-streaming subscribers to 21.8 million from 22 million, and its DVD-only subscribers to 2.2 million from 3 million. \n \n The decline is attributed to Netflix’s plans to split its DVD-rental and video-streaming offerings into two distinct plans. Customers now will have to pay either $7.99 a month for unlimited video streaming, $7.99 a month to have one DVD out a time or $15.98 for both — whereas those plans combined previously had cost $9.99 a month. Those price changes take effect this month. \n \n The news caused a selloff on Netflix stock. By the time the market closed, Netflix’s shares had fallen by $39.46, or almost 19%, to close at $169.25. The losses erased all of Netflix’s gains for the year and sent the shares to their lowest point since last November. \n \n Analysts who previously had been dubious about the company’s prospects found even more ammunition with Thursday’s announcement. “They had been getting more subscribers, which helped them acquire more content, which got them more subscribers,” said Tony Wible of Janney Montgomery Scott, who rates the shares as a sell. “But they found that raising prices and lowering content was a momentum-breaker.” \n \n Netflix’s case hadn’t been helped by a breakdown in talks over continuing its content deal with Liberty Media Corp. LSTZA which provided content from its Starz programming library. The current deal is set to expire at the end of February 2012. \n \n Even analysts that are enthusiastic about Netflix said it’s difficult to find something positive in the company’s subscriber announcement. \n \n “They’re missing most of the subscribers on the DVD-only plan, so that’s kind of the silver lining,” said Mike Olson, of Piper Jaffray. “But they’re missing DVD customers without the offsetting additions in video streaming.” \n \n Olson has a buy rating and $330 price target on Netflix. \n \n Netflix’s share gains had made it one of the market’s stars of the last year, with the company’s stock reaching an all-time high of $304.79 on July 13. At that point, it had risen 73.5% during the year. \n \n “They had a balance that was working at the $8-to-$10 a month price plan,” said Michael Pachter, of Wedbush Securities, who also rates the stock as a sell. “But then content owners wanted more money, so their [Netflix’s] reaction was to charge more for content, and they exacerbated that with a price increase.” \n \n Despite the negative reaction, Netflix stood by its decision to split its pricing plans. \n \n “We know our decision to split our services has upset many of our subscribers, which we don’t take lightly,” the company said in a statement. “But we believe this split will help us make our services better for subscribers and shareholders for years to come.” \n \n Pachter said he wasn’t sold on this reasoning. “Each time you lose some content, you’re going to lose some customers,” he added. “If you reduce your content by X%, you’re going to lose Y% of your customers. Now they’ve raised prices and reduced content, and the value proposition is getting worse.” ||||| Netflix is losing more than it expected from the backlash over its recent price hike. The company revised its third-quarter projected U.S. subscriber numbers downward from 25 million to 24 million, according to a letter to shareholders on Thursday. \n \n To put this in context, look at Netflix’s corresponding numbers from its second quarter shareholder letter (.pdf). Netflix had 24.59 million U.S. subscribers at the end of the second quarter (and only about a million more everywhere else). The company began 2009 with 10 million subscribers, and for two years has shown year-over-year subscriber growth between 26 percent and 64 percent, with profits to match. \n \n Netflix’s executives thought its price hikes would mean slower subscriber growth for the third quarter only; many customers would switch plans, and it would lose older DVD-only subscribers, but offset them with new streaming ones. It didn’t think it might actually lose net customers. Independent analysts were less certain. Netflix’s revised numbers are better than these worst-case projections, but close to the middle of the field. \n \n The open question is whether Netflix has misread the market by a little or a lot. It’s never good to have to revise your projection. Among other things, that’s how shareholders and the stock market set their expectations, and Netflix shares plunged sharply by about 13 percent after the announcement. \n \n Also, every company would like to consistently grow forever, without a single hiccup. This is what I call Netflix’s now-punctured “myth of inevitability.” \n \n Still, a half a million subscriber dip against a half a million subscriber gain isn’t such a big deal if you think Netflix’s trajectory is still solid. That trajectory is what Netflix defends in its letter: \n \n The strategy behind the split of our services is four-fold: to create a dedicated DVD rental division that takes pride in great execution and maximizes the opportunity for disc rental over the coming decade; to enable us to improve our global streaming service even more rapidly, because it is not meshed with a domestic DVD business; to enable us, with the growth in revenue, to license more streaming content and thereby improve our streaming service even more; to remain very price aggressive, with $7.99 per month for unlimited streaming of a huge library of TV shows and movies, and $7.99 per month for unlimited DVD rentals, 1 out at-a-time. We know our decision to split our services has upset many of our subscribers, which we don’t take lightly, but we believe this split will help us make our services better for subscribers and shareholders for years to come. \n \n The trouble is that Netflix didn’t match its streaming-only subscriber uptake number either. There’s more competition for video streaming attention and dollars than ever. New services have launched and other competitors are gradually catching up with Netflix’s catalog size and device support. \n \n The company’s executives now know they have to do better by their existing U.S. customer base and expand its streaming service globally. It could prove very difficult to do both at the same time. \n \n Finally, there are still millions of customers who don’t have a streaming video box or game console, who may not even have high-speed internet, and who still consume most of their video entertainment via DVD. As video stores across America closed, these people turned to Netflix. They were extremely loyal, but also probably the most price-sensitive. \n \n Netflix could have owned these customers for years, like AOL dial-up subscribers, hanging onto them and milking their loyalty in the absence of any real competition. Instead, it pissed them off, losing almost a million. \n \n Netflix has thought and talked about itself as an innovator and technologically forward company for so long that it didn’t realize it was actually still running a legacy business. (Here’s the take by AllThingsD’s Peter Kafka). \n \n It’s a great time to be a streaming-video customer, perhaps especially with Netflix. But Netflix may have been premature here. It doesn’t own the streaming business, even in the U.S. Meanwhile, DVDs are hanging on much longer than anyone expected. \n \n Netflix had the right vision at the right time and built its tech at the right pace but tossed its customers (and their wallets) into the deep end a little too soon.",
    "summary": "– Netflix is taking its lumps today over its price hike and plan changes. After the company announced that it expects to have 1 million fewer US subscribers than projected at the end of the third quarter—24 million, instead of 25 million—its shares slid about 15%, reports MarketWatch. The big hit is in DVD-only customers: The company now expects to have 2.2 million of those, down from the projected 3 million. It also revised its projection for streaming-only customers down from 22 million to 21.8 million. Considering that Netflix had 24.59 million US customers at the end of the second quarter, this means that the pricing changes will result in a net loss of customers of about 500,000, notes Tim Carmody at Wired. \"Netflix may have been premature here,\" he adds. \"It doesn’t own the streaming business, even in the US.

    "document": "Hillary Clinton discusses the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement during an interview with PBS News Hour. Clinton sides with progressives against Obama trade deal Her stance puts her in stark opposition with the White House — and Vice President Joe Biden, who could still challenge her in the coming days — once again. \n \n Hillary Clinton went further than ever before to distance herself from President Barack Obama, coming out against a Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement that she worked to support as a member of his administration. \n \n “As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it,” the 2016 candidate said just days before the first Democratic debate, where she will face liberal rivals Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley. “I don’t believe it’s going to meet the high bar I have set.\" \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n By coming out against the deal, Clinton sides with labor unions and appeals to primary voters in a tightening presidential race. But her opposition now worries some supporters who said they fear Clinton could be pushed too far left in a primary and become vulnerable in a general election. \n \n \"I think if Hillary Clinton were not running for president, she'd probably support the thing,\" a Democratic operative and Clinton ally said. \n \n \"I worry about it on two points,” the person added. “One, that she will be accused of pandering, and two, that there is a general election constituency to think of.\" \n \n Some Democratic operatives argued that her decision was a no-brainer for a presidential candidate because the only people who care about TPP as a litmus-test voting issue are those opposed to it. \n \n But her stance puts her once again in stark opposition with the White House — and Vice President Joe Biden, who could still challenge her in the coming days. Indeed, the list of breaks from her former boss has grown in recent weeks. \n \n After months of refusing to answer questions about the Keystone XL pipeline — which is still under White House review — Clinton came out against its construction for environmental reasons in September. Shortly thereafter, she announced her opposition to the so-called Cadillac tax on expensive health care benefits that is part of the Affordable Care Act. \n \n Clinton also pledged to go further than the White House on immigration reform and gun control regulations — other domestic policy issues that align her with the liberals pressuring her. \n \n She has also weighed in from the opposite side, advocating for the administration to impose a no-fly zone in Syria. \n \n It’s a striking string of disagreements with Obama, capped by discord today that has been brewing ever since she announced her candidacy in April. But the White House was not surprised by Wednesday’s development: Clinton's staff gave the administration a heads up today, according to a White House official. \n \n \"I'm continuing to learn about the details of the new Trans-Pacific Partnership, including looking hard at what's in there to crack down on currency manipulation, which kills American jobs, and to make sure we're not putting the interests of drug companies ahead of patients and consumers. But based on what I know so far, I can't support this agreement,\" Clinton said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. \n \n Her decision won her praise from progressive groups, including Democracy for America, but criticism from moderate Democrats with ties to Clinton. \n \n \"Secretary Clinton has pledged to run a campaign to do one thing above all: restore middle class prosperity. But there is no path to middle class prosperity without opening the doors to the vast Asian market, and there is no way to do that without the TPP Agreement,” said former Clinton administration official Jonathan Cowan, now president of the moderate Third Way think tank. \n \n Labor leaders and Clinton’s opponents have been eager to have her on their side, but her hesitance to weigh in had also given hope to supporters of the deal. \n \n In Clinton's 2014 book, \"Hard Choices,\" she acknowledged that an agreement would be \"important for American workers, who would benefit from competing on a more level playing field. And it was a strategic initiative that would strengthen the position of the United States in Asia.\" \n \n Still, she warned in the memoir, \"Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing, it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement. It's safe to say that the TPP won't be perfect — no deal negotiated among a dozen countries ever will be — but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers.\" \n \n O'Malley, for one, immediately weighed in, pointing to Clinton's shift. \n \n \"Wow! What a reversal! I was against the Trans-Pacific Partnership months, and months ago,\" he told the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute in Washington on Wednesday shortly after the news of Clinton's stance broke. \n \n \"I believe we need to stop stumbling backwards into bad deals and Secretary Clinton can justify her own reversal of opinion on this, but I didn't have one opinion eight months ago and switch that opinion on the eve of the debates.\" \n \n In her Wednesday statement, Clinton pinned part of the blame for her switch on Congressional Republicans. \n \n \"We can’t look at this in a vacuum,\" she said. \"Years of Republican obstruction at home have weakened U.S. competitiveness and made it harder for Americans who lose jobs and pay because of trade to get back on their feet.\" ||||| Photo \n \n Hillary Rodham Clinton dealt a significant blow to President Obama in his efforts to secure approval from Congress on his signature trade agreement, saying on Wednesday she could not support the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation trade pact that she bolstered as secretary of state and that liberals in the Democratic Party have vehemently opposed. \n \n After months of delicately avoiding expressing an opinion on the controversial trade deal, Mrs. Clinton said the agreement in its current form did not meet her high bar for protecting American workers, the environment and advancing national security. \n \n Her opposition to the trade pact comes just before next Tuesday’s first Democratic presidential debate and represents the latest and most potentially damaging break with Mr. Obama. \n \n In recent weeks, Mrs. Clinton has taken a series of stands important to the liberal wing of the party, which has been increasingly swept up by the insurgent candidacy of Senator Bernie Sanders. Last week, she proposed doing away with the so-called Cadillac tax on certain health care plans, aligning herself with labor unions on undoing a key part of President Obama’s Affordable Care Act. Last month, she came out against the Keystone XL pipeline, which the administration has not yet decided on. \n \n But while Mrs. Clinton’s opposition to the trade pact could do much to appease Democratic voters and labor unions that have seized on the deal as a symbol for the perils of globalization, her decision to repudiate a major legislative goal of Mr. Obama’s — one she initially supported — carries significant political risks. \n \n In a statement, Mrs. Clinton said she was still studying the details of the pact — the largest regional trade deal in history and aimed at bringing together nations representing two-fifths of the global economy. \n \n “But based on what I know so far, I can’t support this agreement,” she wrote. “The bar here is very high and, based on what I have seen, I don’t believe this agreement has met it.” \n \n As soon as Mrs. Clinton made her opinion known her opponents seized on her apparent inconsistency on the issue. \n \n In a 2012 speech in Australia, Mrs. Clinton had said the trade pact, which would bring together the economies of countries from Chile to Canada to Japan, “sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open, free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.” \n \n “Wow! That’s a reversal!” said Martin O’Malley, a former governor of Maryland who is also seeking the Democratic nomination. Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, called Mrs. Clinton’s position “a case study in political expediency.” \n \n And, as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. contemplates his own run for the presidency, Mrs. Clinton risks alienating Mr. Obama’s coalition of African-American supporters, partly drawn to her candidacy because of her loyal service in the Obama administration. \n \n Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Biden have similar records on many issues, but by rejecting policies like the trade pact, Mrs. Clinton can draw a distinction with him in anticipation a potential challenge. \n \n Mr. Biden said in a statement Wednesday that he supported the deal and would help Mr. Obama pass it in Congress. But during an event with organized labor at the White House, he stressed the need for greater collective bargaining to help workers. “Folks in the other team argue it’s all about globalization,” he said. \n \n On Wednesday, hours before Mrs. Clinton first made her opinion known in an interview with PBS, the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, hinted at displeasure inside the West Wing about Democratic opposition to Mr. Obama. He said he hoped Democrats would “remain open to the strong case we have to make.” \n \n Now that Mrs. Clinton has made her views known, Mr. Obama is in the awkward position of pushing a deal that could cement his economic and foreign policy legacy and that he says would “rebalance” relations between the United States and eastern Asia as his former secretary of state campaigns against it. \n \n Because of late concessions to the pact, Mr. Obama has likely lost the support of some key Republicans in Congress, putting added pressure on him to appeal to Democrats who may be less inclined to get behind the deal now that the party’s most prominent presidential candidate has spoken out against it. \n \n “I appreciate the hard work that President Obama and his team put into this process and recognize the strides they made,” Mrs. Clinton wrote in the statement. \n \n She specifically criticized the agreement for lacking sufficient protections against currency manipulation, which she said “kills American jobs,” and provisions that benefit global pharmaceutical companies over patients. \n \n But the current version of the pact is far more attuned to these issues than it was in 2012, when Mrs. Clinton supported the deal. \n \n After the last two rounds of negotiations, in Atlanta and in Maui, concessions were made to cut back on the number of years drug companies could receive intellectual property protection and to ensure that tobacco companies could not use the agreement’s adjudication procedures to sue countries over their antismoking efforts. \n \n On Wednesday, the White House released a report citing the economic benefits of the trade agreement, saying it would eliminate 18,000 taxes that other countries impose on the sale of goods produced in America. \n \n Mrs. Clinton’s adroitly worded statement appeared to leave an opening for her to change her mind, should the deal continue to morph. \n \n “I still believe in the goal of a strong and fair trade agreement in the Pacific as part of a broader strategy both at home and abroad, as I did when I was secretary of state,” she wrote. \n \n The cautious rejection of the deal had echoes of Mrs. Clinton’s complicated approach to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which former President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1993 and which still enrages labor unions and liberals. \n \n In the 2008 Democratic contest, Mrs. Clinton tried to gingerly oppose Nafta, a central piece of her husband’s economic legacy. “The fact is, she was saying great things about Nafta until she was running for president,” Mr. Obama said of Mrs. Clinton during their 2008 nominating fight.",
    "summary": "– Hillary Clinton announced her opposition to the historically massive Trans-Pacific Partnership Wednesday, further distancing herself from the Obama administration while aligning herself with the more liberal wing of the Democratic party, including primary opponent Bernie Sanders, Politico reports. \"As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it,” Clinton tells PBS. “I don’t believe it’s going to meet the high bar I have set.\" Clinton had previously supported the deal while working for the administration as secretary of state. PBS reports the deal between the US and 11 other countries would remove trade barriers and set labor and environmental standards. It would be the largest regional trade agreement in history. Clinton tells PBS she opposes the deal because it doesn't address currency manipulation and appears to be better for pharmaceutical companies than patients. Sanders, who Clinton will be debating in a few days, claims the agreement will be bad for American consumers and jobs. The New York Times reports Clinton's position could help her steal liberal and union support from Sanders and distance her from Vice President Biden, who may enter the race. According to Politico, Clinton's announcement is part of a \"striking string of disagreements with Obama\" over issues like the Keystone XL pipeline and the Affordable Care Act's so-called Cadillac tax. The Trans-Pacific Partnership was completed Monday and still needs to be approved by Congress, PBS reports."

    "document": "I’ve never been to Charleston, S.C., but I’m pretty sure that, for this afternoon at least, Randolph Hall at the College of Charleston was located at the intersection of Reality and Satire. There it was that Stephen Colbert and Herman Cain, unlikely ballotfellows, held a funny, serious and seriously funny rally to promote Colbert’s bid to get South Carolinians to vote for him by voting for Herman Cain in the state’s Jan. 21 primary. \n \n If you haven’t been following the story, Colbert, having failed to get on the state’s Republican ballot for his satirical run and stymied by a no-write-ins rule, decided to take advantage of the fact that non-candidate Herman Cain remains on the ballot. Appearing with the pizza executive and onetime Republican frontrunner, Colbert introduced him as “a man with ideas, a man with conviction, a man with a bus with his face on it.” And a man his supporters can game the primary rules by legally voting for. \n \n Colbert, a sometime musical theater actor, opened the rally by leading the crowd and a gospel choir in a singalong of “This Little Light of Mine”—complete with key change—then took the harmony in the National Anthem. The Comedy Central host was not there to campaign negatively, he vowed: “I will not say that the only difference between Mitt Romney and a statue of Mitt Romney is that the statue never changes its position.” He was not there to pander: ” I know I don’t need to pander… to the most beautiful people in the world!” \n \n Then Colbert turned over the stage to “the man we’ve all gathered here to see introduce me.” Cain, for his part addressed the crowd as if it were a dead-serious political rally and he were still a candidate. Though with Herman Cain, “dead serious” still allows for some latitude. Colbert, he said, asked for his help because “he does not have my complexion perfection. That was a joke, y’all.” \n \n But he then launched into a straight, earnest call for his listeners to visit his political site, CainConnections.com (I’ll let you make the dating joke) and urged the crowd to join him in changing a “broken” system from the outside. \n \n How? I can’t tell you, not to slight Cain or his message but because my online video feed cut out for several minutes at this point. (The major cable-news networks, perhaps unsurprisingly, did not air the rally live, though CNN, NBC News and other sites carried the online feed.) It returned just in time for Cain to finish up, and I am not making this up, by singing “Believe in Yourself (Dorothy)” from The Wiz. \n \n Then it was back to Colbert, whose message was also about a broken political system, albeit delivered with straight-faced irony. Colbert set up a real campaign super PAC last year to spoof, and educate about, the results of the Citizens United Supreme Court case, which he said today addressed “tragic lack of influence by corporations” by letting companies, unions and individuals anonymous contribute millions to political action groups. He then turned it over to crony Jon Stewart as he ran in South Carolina to spoof, well, how easily a “noncoordinated” super PAC can be turned over to your cronies. \n \n Colbert did all this, he said today, “to make your voice heard, in the form of my voice. Well, nation, I have to ask: can you hear you now?” If so, he beseeched, “Tomorrow, Jan. 21, the two-year anniversary of Citizens United, you can thank the Supreme Court by going into that booth and voting for Herman Cain.” \n \n It was appropriate enough that the day involved a serenade from The Wiz by a recent major candidate. Because it sure feels like we’ve been spirited into some alternative world, one where comedians turn into political leaders and political leaders into comics like ordinary people transmuting into lions and tin woodsmen, where the theatrical tropes of late-night political satire meet the actual language of political candidates. \n \n “The pundits have asked,” Colbert said, if his campaign is all a joke. “If they are calling being allowed to form a super PAC and [collect] unlimited and untraceable amounts of money from individuals and unions and corporations and spend that money on political ads and for personal enrichment and surrender that super PAC to one of my closest friends while I explore a run for office—if that is a joke, then they are saying our entire campaign finance system is a joke.” And if corporations are indeed people, he concluded, then it follows that “government of those people, by those people and paid for by those people shall not perish from this Earth!” \n \n It’s funny, as they say, because it’s true. ||||| Comedian Stephen Colbert, who says he's running for president of \"The United States of South Carolina,\" is urging voters there to cast their ballots in Saturday's presidential primary for former GOP hopeful Herman Cain. \n \n (Click Prev or Next to continue viewing images.) \n \n ADVERTISEMENT (Click Prev or Next to continue viewing images.) \n \n Kelley Dailey, a College of Charleston student, holds a sign as fans line up to attend comedian Stephen Colbert's \"Rock Me Like a Herman Cain South Cain-olina Primary Rally\" at the college in Charleston,...

Colbert \"launched\" his exploratory bid too late to get on the ballot in South Carolina. \n \n But Colbert had a scheme. \n \n \"I want you to vote for Herman Cain because Herman Cain is me,\" said Colbert. \n \n \"He possesses the one thing I don't have, a place on the ballot.\" \n \n Cain told the crowd he was \"not offended\" by Colbert appropriating his name--people ought to lighten up, he said, but he did not agree with the scheme. \n \n \"I don't want you to waste your vote.\" \n \n And as we know from Iowa--where 34 votes separated Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney--every vote makes a difference. \n \n Comedy Central called the College of Charleston on Tuesday to ask that Colbert be allowed to hold the rally as part of the school \"Bully Pulpit\" series featuring presidential primary contenders.",

    "document": "BAKERSFIELD, Calif. - Local gun vendors are seeing a trend in handgun sales: seniors slinging pistols. \n \n Assistant manager of Second Amendment Sports, Justyn Vest, says he's seen an increase in sales to older clients for personal safety. Often, gun ownership and shooting is a hobby popular in the retirement community. Vest says it's because it can be a time consuming hobby, which retirees often enjoy. \n \n The NRA has seen a 400% increase in those 60 years of age or older training with firearms. \n \n Local gun owner Steve, who didn't want to provide his last name, is nearing 70 years old and says the increase in interest doesn't surprise him. \"We don not have the same vigor and strength that we once had so we feel maybe a little bit more vulnerable,\" said Steve. \n \n He owns guns for personal safety and as a hobby. \n \n He visits the range about once a month to polish his skills, stressing that practice and gun safety awareness is the most important factor in responsible ownership. \n \n As for critics of older citizens owning guns, Vest say's that's quite the contrary. \"In my experience, they train the most. They have the most time,\" said Vest. ||||| AUSTINTOWN, Ohio—On a recent Monday at the Austintown Senior Center, activities included painting, bingo and shooting guns. \n \n Around 9:45 a.m., a dozen people in their 60s and 70s bundled into a van and several cars and headed to the nearby American Range shooting gallery, whose lobby features a portrait of Clint Eastwood over the legend “Go ahead make your day.” Soon, they were blasting away at paper targets dangling in a dim, damp room with cinder-block walls. \n \n Afterward, Phyllis Engler, a recently retired physical education teacher, was pleased with her debut. “I have arthritis in my shoulder so it was hard holding [the pistol] out, but I think with practice I’ll be fine,” said the 63-year-old. She planned to buy a pistol and apply for a concealed-carry permit. She had a message for criminals: “They better not mess with the women of Austintown.” \n \n The National Rifle Association says 22,739 people over 65 took basic firearm training courses from NRA-certified instructors in 2015, four times the number five years earlier. An NRA spokesman said the growth in that age category was much faster than the overall rate but didn’t provide additional data. \n \n Gun sales in the U.S. are soaring, thanks in part to demand from senior citizens. And seniors are also flocking to shooting lessons, according to the NRA. Photo: Maddie McGarvey for The Wall Street Journal \n \n Gun dealers around the country agreed that more seniors, worried about crime and terrorism, are showing up for lessons. \n \n In Bay City, Mich., Glenn Duncan, owner of Duncan’s Outdoor Shop, estimated that at least a third of his students are senior citizens, compared with 10% five years ago. The National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade group, estimates that the average age of people involved in target shooting with handguns rose to 42.4 in 2014 from 39.1 five years earlier. \n \n Many dealers and older people around the country said personal safety was the priority. Knowing how to shoot gives older people “a sense of security and safety,” said Rex Gore, owner of Black Wing Shooting Center in Delaware, Ohio, who has had students as old as 95. “It’s a great equalizer in this crazy world we live in.” \n \n Stephen Eyler, 71, who owns a printing shop in Oklahoma City, began thinking about buying a pistol after two incidents in which he and his wife, Shirley, felt threatened by strangers. The Eylers worried about random shootings, people with mental problems and “radicals,” Mr. Eyler said: “You see it on the news almost every day.” \n \n In early March, after researching guns on the Internet, he bought two Glock semiautomatic pistols, one for himself and a smaller model for his wife, at H&H Shooting Sports in Oklahoma City. The couple signed up for lessons at H&H and plan to get concealed-carry permits so they can stow the pistols in their car’s glove compartment. \n \n “Today’s buyers are scared,” said Miles Hall, who owns H&H Shooting. \n \n Some say those buyers may also be misguided. David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at Harvard University, said “the evidence is pretty strong that [owning a gun] isn’t going to help you.” Having a gun at home increases the risks for suicide and accidental shootings, he said, and it is hard to shoot an intruder or assailant: “Your heart starts beating like crazy,” he said. “If they’re running at you, you have half a second or something.” \n \n So what can worried seniors do? “Get a dog, get a good lock, get good neighbors, get a cellphone,” Prof. Hemenway said. \n \n Demand from seniors is one reason the U.S. gun business is booming. In the three months through February, criminal background checks related to gun purchases were up 29% from a year earlier, according to the shooting sports foundation. Aside from concerns about crime and terrorism, fear of an eventual regulatory crackdown on gun ownership is driving some of the demand, gun dealers say. Sales at Smith & Wesson Holding Corp. , one of the biggest U.S. gun makers, jumped 62% in the quarter ended Jan. 31, and its stock price has more than doubled in the past 12 months. \n \n Dave Campbell, 62, who was an editor for an NRA publication before retiring to a rural home near Powell, Wyo., said he got started teaching the elderly about guns because an older woman at his church asked him for lessons. The stress is on safety, Mr. Campbell said, and he keeps expectations in check: “You’re not going to turn these people into SEAL team operators.” \n \n Rising demand from seniors shows that “life has changed. Law enforcement agencies can’t protect everyone,” said Mr. Duncan of Duncan’s Outdoor Shop. He said seniors also show up because they’re looking for hobbies; target shooting doesn’t require as much mobility as golf or tennis.",

But let me tell you, whatever our disagreements may be, I've come here to say: We must put them aside for the good of our country. And we must unite around the candidate who can defeat a dangerous demagogue.\" \n \n Bloomberg used his perspective as a businessman, New Yorker and former mayor to hit Trump from multiple angles. \n \n \"I'm a New Yorker, and New Yorkers know a con when we see one,\" he said to cheers from the audience. \n \n Read More ||||| Michael Bloomberg, the self-made billionaire and former Republican mayor of New York City, on Wednesday night told the Democratic National Convention that Hillary Clinton must be elected for the good of the country. \n \n Bloomberg, now an independent, said that he is not endorsing the Democratic Party platform, going so far as to say that Democrats too often blame the private sector for economic troubles, and are obstructionists on issues of education reform and deficit reduction. \n \n But he also said that he believes Trump is a “dangerous demagogue” who must be defeated, and that not all business experience is created equal. \n \n “Most of us who have created a business know that we’re only as good as the way our employees, clients and partners view us,” Bloomberg explained. “Most of us don’t pretend we’re smart enough to make every big decision by ourselves. And most of us who have our names on the door know that we are only as good as our word, but not Donald Trump.” \n \n Bloomberg ripped Trump’s business history, including his multiple bankruptcies and approximately 3,500 lawsuits. The current Bloomberg LP CEO also added that he didn’t need a million dollar check from his father to start his company. \n \n “Trump says he wants to run the nation like he’s run his business. God help us. I’m a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one.” \n \n Bloomberg had given serious thought to running for president himself, and was viewed by many as a moderate alternative in the event of a Bernie Sanders nomination by the Democrats. By March, however, Bloomberg had determined that his candidacy would be futile, resulting in the election of either Trump or Sen. Ted Cruz; which he referred to as “a risk I can’t take in good conscience.”",

    "document": "A new global analysis of the distribution of forests and woodlands has “found” 467 million hectares of previously unreported forest – an area equivalent to 60% of the size of Australia. \n \n The discovery increases the known amount of global forest cover by around 9%, and will significantly boost estimates of how much carbon is stored in plants worldwide. \n \n The new forests were found by surveying “drylands” – so called because they receive much less water in precipitation than they lose through evaporation and plant transpiration. As we and our colleagues report today in the journal Science, these drylands contain 45% more forest than has been found in previous surveys. \n \n We found new dryland forest on all inhabited continents, but mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, around the Mediterranean, central India, coastal Australia, western South America, northeastern Brazil, northern Colombia and Venezuela, and northern parts of the boreal forests in Canada and Russia. In Africa, our study has doubled the amount of known dryland forest. \n \n With current satellite imagery and mapping techniques, it might seem amazing that these forests have stayed hidden in plain sight for so long. But this type of forest was previously difficult to measure globally, because of the relatively low density of trees. \n \n What’s more, previous surveys were based on older, low-resolution satellite images that did not include ground validation. In contrast, our study used higher-resolution satellite imagery available through Google Earth Engine – including images of more than 210,000 dryland sites – and used a simple visual interpretation of tree number and density. A sample of these sites were compared with field information to assess accuracy. \n \n Unique opportunity \n \n Given that drylands – which make up about 40% of Earth’s land surface – have more capacity to support trees and forest than we previously realised, we have a unique chance to combat climate change by conserving these previously unappreciated forests. \n \n Drylands contain some of the most threatened, yet disregarded, ecosystems, many of which face pressure from climate change and human activity. Climate change will cause many of these regions to become hotter and even drier, while human expansion could degrade these landscapes yet further. Climate models suggest that dryland biomes could expand by 11-23% by the end of the this century, meaning they could cover more than half of Earth’s land surface. \n \n Considering the potential of dryland forests to stave off desertification and to fight climate change by storing carbon, it will be crucial to keep monitoring the health of these forests, now that we know they are there. \n \n TERN AusPlots , Author provided \n \n Climate policy boost \n \n The discovery will dramatically improve the accuracy of models used to calculate how much carbon is stored in Earth’s landscapes. This in turn will help calculate the carbon budgets by which countries can measure their progress towards the targets set out in the Kyoto Protocol and its successor, the Paris Agreement. \n \n Our study increases the estimates of total global forest carbon stocks by anywhere between 15 gigatonnes and 158 gigatonnes of carbon – an increase of between 2% and 20%. \n \n This study provides more accurate baseline information on the current status of carbon sinks, on which future carbon and climate modelling can be based. This will reduce errors for modelling of dryland regions worldwide. Our discovery also highlights the importance of conservation and forest growth in these areas. \n \n The authors acknowledge the input of Jean-François Bastin and Mark Grant in the writing of this article. The research was carried out by researchers from 14 organisations around the world, as part of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization’s Global Forest Survey. ||||| Forests equal to 60pc of Australian landmass discovered using new tool \n \n Posted \n \n Vast stretches of previously undocumented forest have been discovered using a new tool to analyse the surface of the Earth. \n \n International researchers have discovered 467 million hectares, an area equivalent to 60 per cent of the size of Australia, of what was previously considered dry land is actually dense forest. \n \n The research led by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, teams of scientists and students from 15 organisations, including the University of Adelaide, carried out the analysis using the photo-interpretation tool called Collect Earth. \n \n University of Adelaide's plant conservation biology chairman Professor Andrew Lowe said the finding meant scientists had a new resource that could help mitigate climate change. \n \n \"In the modern digital age we think we know everything about the Earth, but a lot of that knowledge comes from satellite imagery, like Google Earth,\" he said. \n \n \"But when you use that type of satellite data you have to make estimations on what type of vegetation occurs on the ground.\" \n \n It turns out some of those estimations were wrong and areas across the globe, including along parts of the Australian coast, are full of trees and plants. \n \n He said if the newly discovered forests are protected, they could provide information about how trees \"fix\" carbon, and prompt a re-evaluation of the global \"carbon budget\". \n \n \"We know that forests sequester huge amounts of carbon, so increasing the area of forest globally helps explain additional carbon sequestration opportunities that are available,\" Professor Lowe said. \n \n The study identified dryland forest across all inhabited continents, and concentrated to the south of the Sahara desert, around the Mediterranean, south Africa, central India, coastal Australia, western South America, north-east Brazil, northern Colombia and Venezuela, and northern parts of the boreal forests in Canada and Russia. \n \n The paper published today in the journal Science states the differences in coverage were most significant in Africa, where the estimates have doubled. \n \n Topics: science-and-technology, earth-sciences, environment, environmental-impact, environment-education, education, environmental-technology, research, adelaide-university-5005, sa ||||| A new estimate of dryland forests suggests that the global forest cover is at least 9% higher than previously thought. The finding will help reduce uncertainties surrounding terrestrial carbon sink estimates. \n \n Dryland biomes, where precipitation is more than counterbalanced by evaporation from surfaces and transpiration by plants, cover about 40% of the Earth's land surface. \n \n These biomes contain some of the most threatened ecosystems, including biodiversity hotspots. However, previous estimates of dryland forests have been riddled with disparities, caused by issues such as differences in satellite spatial resolution, mapping approaches and forest definitions. \n \n These disparities have led to major doubts about the reliability of global forest area estimates, and to questions about the real contribution made by forests to the global carbon cycle. Here, Jean-Francois Bastin et al. analyzed satellite data from Google Earth, using a detail sample pool of 213,795 0.5 hectare plots from around the globe. \n \n Their new estimate of dryland forest is 40 to 47% higher than previous estimates, corresponding to 467 million hectares (Mha) of forest that have never been reported before. \n \n This increases current estimates of global forest cover by at least 9%. These results explain the difference between recent global estimates of forest \"land use\" area (3890 Mha) and the area with a \"land cover,\" the authors say. ||||| Thank you for your interest in spreading the word about Science. \n \n NOTE: We only request your email address so that the person you are recommending the page to knows that you wanted them to see it, and that it is not junk mail.

    "summary": "– Scientists have discovered 467 million hectares of unreported forest—about three-fifths the size of Australia—scattered around the globe, the Conversation reports. The discovery increases the known global forest cover by about 9%. The study—published Friday in Science—focused on \"drylands,\" areas that lose more water through evaporation and plant transpiration than they receive in precipitation. Trees in drylands aren't very dense, which can make it difficult to measure possible forest cover. According to a press release, old estimates of dryland forests were off due to a number of factors, including low image resolution from satellites and the methods of mapping used. The new study used high-resolution images of more than 210,000 dryland sites from Google Earth Engine and combined them with observations on the ground. Researchers found between 40% to 47% more forest cover in the world's drylands than previously reported. New forests were found on all continents—besides Antarctica.

Amanda hasn’t spoken to her parents in several months and she has been living like a recluse, which does have her parents extremely concerned. Amanda just cut them out of her life entirely, and she doesn’t return their phone calls or e-mails. There wasn’t a fight or any ongoing unresolved issues between Amanda and her parents, she just axed them out of her life for no reason.” \n \n PHOTOS: Celebrity Mugshots \n \n As WE previously reported, Bynes wasn’t required to post bail in her DUI case, because Judge Elden Fox didn’t think it was necessary at this point. Bynes was ordered not to drive unless she had a valid driver’s license, and Judge Fox warned that if she violates that order he would set bail for a “very high amount.” \n \n The Hairspray star was also charged by the Los Angeles City Attorney with two hit and run charges and was arrested on April 6 for a DUI after allegedly sideswiping a police car. \n \n PHOTOS: Celebs Who Have Done Jail Time \n \n Bynes, 26, was pulled over and cited once again for driving on a suspended license in Burbank on Sunday morning, which resulted in her car being impounded. \n \n Days before her car was taken away from her, Bynes was photographed driving illegally last Tuesday on that suspended license and allegedly smoking drugs from a pipe in her car. \n \n “The only way that Amanda’s parents find out what is going on with her is from the media. They love their daughter very, very much though and are just heartbroken and very concerned for her,” the insider says. \n \n RELATED STORIES: \n \n Amanda Bynes Refusing Rehab: ‘She’s A Lost Little Girl,’ Says Pal \n \n Amanda Bynes Caught Driving AGAIN On A Suspended License: With Scarf Covering Her Face! \n \n Amanda Bynes Vows To Fight DUI Charges \n \n Cops Clear Amanda Bynes In New Hit And Run Incident ||||| EXCLUSIVE \n \n Lindsay Lohan’s NYC arrest was simply karma kicking her in the ass for tweeting bad things about Amanda Bynes ... at least that’s what Amanda is telling her friends. \n \n \n \n We KNOW Amanda is still pissed over Lohan's tweet Monday which read, “Why did I get put in jail and a nickelodeon star has had NO punishment(s) so far?\" \n \n \n \n Bynes is griping ... Lindsay has been convicted of multiple crimes (a rap sheet as long as her IMDB page), while Amanda has been convicted of nada. \n \n \n \n Still, Bynes is telling friends Lohan’s new legal troubles are “what she gets” for talking smack on Twitter … adding Lindsay simply is “not cool.” ||||| Amanda Bynes BOOTED from Gym Class For Weird Behavior \n \n Amanda Bynes -- BOOTED from Gym Class for Weird Behavior \n \n EXCLUSIVE \n \n acted so bizarre during a workout class in Hollywood Tuesday night ... her instructor stopped the session halfway through and kicked her out -- TMZ has learned.Gym sources tell us, Amanda was attending a 50-minute spin class at Equinox when she suddenly stopped participating in the class and aimlessly walked around looking to switch bikes.Once Amanda found a replacement -- closer to the room's giant mirror -- we're told Amanda started cycling again, but removed her top, revealing a \"tiny black strapless push up bra ... not a sports bra.\"Roughly 25 minutes into the class, we're told Amanda stopped cycling again -- this time to pick up her Louis Vuitton purse ... and reapply her makeup.According to sources, the actress was doing her makeup -- lipstick, eyeliner, the whole shebang -- for ten full minutes before the instructor grew furious and told her to get out, claiming he couldn't BELIEVE someone was doing makeup in the middle of his spin class.Amanda then left the room and the class continued. For the record, the actress has not been permanently banned from the gym. ||||| Guys, I think I have this Amanda Bynes thing figured out. Although her behavior has seemed mystifyingly strange lately, what with racking up those endless driving violations and all (I mean, when Lindsay Lohan bags on someone for being a public menace you know the situation's officially gotten out of control), Bynes actually started flying her freak flag more than two years ago. \n \n I'd totally forgotten about this, but Bynes made headlines in June of 2010 when she jumped on Twitter at 3 a.m. to announce that she was done with acting. \"I know 24 is a young age to retire,\" she wrote, \"but you heard it here first I've retired.\" \n \n She \"unretired\" a whopping 35 days later, and according to some sources, the retirement was all a cover-up for the real reason she wasn't being seen on the big screen: Hollywood was sick of her increasingly bizarre behavior. \n \n According to the Daily Beast, in the spring of 2010, Bynes was kicked out of the Farrelly brothers’ film, Hall Pass. Although Bynes tweeted that she left because of \"scheduling conflicts,\" word on the street says otherwise: \n \n One source said Bynes had acted strangely during the filming—paranoid and fearful. Star Owen Wilson and the Farrellys wanted Bynes to continue in the film if she could get a hold of herself, but nothing changed—the co-directors, the source said, kept the cameras running in between takes to show Bynes' odd behavior in case anyone from her camp decided to sue. \n \n Bynes was named one of People's \"25 Hottest Stars Under 25\" in 2006, but before her \"retirement,\" she had a number of professional missteps: a failed clothing line, a canned TV pilot, and a movie that went straight to video. And despite the fact that she retired from retiring, she hasn't worked since 2010's Easy A. \n \n More from The Stir: Amanda Bynes May Have More Serious Problems Than Her Driving Skills (VIDEO) \n \n \n \n So basically she went from being a hugely popular child star to a young woman who can't find success in Hollywood. Is it any wonder she's been headed straight for a giant meltdown? I'm not saying it's a valid excuse, I'm just saying that based on historical evidence, the odds on her transitioning to adulthood as a healthy, well-adjusted person weren't good. \n \n Who knows what's going to happen next with Amanda Bynes, but based on the reports of her mental instability -- including yesterday's disturbing behavior in a clothing store dressing room -- it sounds like she's headed for a pretty big fall. Here's hoping someone can convince her to get some help before it's too late. \n \n Do you think Amanda Bynes' early fame contributed to her current problems? \n \n \n \n \n \n Image via Maxim",
    "summary": "– Amanda Bynes will have you know that she is \"doing amazing,\" thank you very much. The apparently-troubled 26-year-old insists, in a new interview with People, that she doesn't drink and drive. \"It is all false,\" says Bynes, who has had numerous vehicular scrapes lately and is reportedly declining mentally. According to Bynes, however, she's retired from acting and is perfectly happy launching a fashion line and moving to New York. (She also thinks it's perfect karma that Lindsay Lohan got arrested right after snarkily tweeting about her.) But her words say one thing, and her actions say quite another, according to the chatter: She looked like \"a mess\" at a Hollywood gym this week, taking her shirt off during a spin class to reveal not a sports bra but \"a tiny, black, strapless push-up bra,\" a source tells People. She then spent 10 minutes doing her make-up, adjusting her bra, and fixing her hair before putting her shirt back on and leaving. In TMZ's version of the story, Bynes actually got kicked out of the class by the irate instructor. Also this week, Bynes went shopping in Hollywood and locked herself in a dressing room at a boutique for almost two hours, TMZ reports. When asked by concerned clerks to come out, she said, \"I need more time,\" and banging sounds were heard coming from the room every 10 minutes. When Bynes finally emerged, she bought a few things, and almost left the store without paying for a bathing suit top she was still wearing under her dress. Radar reports that Bynes' parents haven't heard from her in months, and are worried. But sources say they haven't moved from Texas to California to help their daughter, as has been reported. Bynes was in court yesterday, and the judge warned that if she breaks any more road laws, she'll impose bail. Click to read about why we all should have seen this meltdown coming two years ago."

    "document": "Hillary Clinton’s appearance on the cover of the People magazine has raised some eyebrows—and not for her comments about Monica Lewinsky or her potential role in the 2016 presidential race. \n \n Instead, some Twitter pundits are focusing less on Clinton’s words than on her hands. Due to the way the cover is cropped, some say the pose resembles that of someone leaning on a walker. ||||| Hillary Clinton Opens Up About Becoming a Grandmother – and Possible Presidential Run \n \n Grandma in Chief?Becoming a grandmother in the fall could influence Hillary Clinton's decision-making – and not just which carseat to buy (though there's that, too).After stepping down as Secretary of State in 2013 and enjoying her first free time in a long time, Clinton is now pondering another run for the White House.\"I know I have a decision to make,\" she recently told PEOPLE in her first at-home interview since the end of husband Bill's presidency in January 2001. \"But part of what I've been thinking about, is everything I'm interested in and everything I enjoy doing – and with the extra added joy of 'I'm about to become a grandmother,' I want to live in the moment. At the same time I am concerned about what I see happening in the country and in the world.\"Before Clinton left public life after more than two decades, she fantasized out loud about finally getting to sleep in.How'd that go? \"Oh, my gosh. I slept in to probably 8 o'clock,\" she said with a chuckle. \"That's good, huh?\"Clinton provided a glimpse into her life as a private citizen these past 16 months, even dishing on organizing her closets and binge-watching TV.\"Oh, that was good, too,\" she said, describing a little self-consciously how she and her husband Bill \"totally binge-watched\" the first season of House of Cards. Part of the appeal, she explained, was \"a little bit of the, 'Oh, my gosh, I can't believe we can just sit here and do this' and 'We're only going to watch one episode, oh, let's watch another. Okay, well, we have time, we're not going anywhere, let's watch a third.' I know that sounds kind of devoid of content.\"But, she adds, \"It wasn't like I was just lying around trying to catch up on 20 years of lost sleep.\"With her name (and daughter Chelsea's) now alongside Bill's on the Clinton Foundation, Hillary has been pursuing meaty projects to stop elephant poaching in Africa (and the illegal ivory trade that funds terror groups), improve the global status of women and girls and promote education.\"I'm just too active and involved,\" she said. \"But what I've loved is having my own schedule.\"So don't count on the once – and maybe again – presidential candidate to lie around in front of Orange Is the New Black.

    "document": "7 years ago \n \n (CNN) - After playing basketball at Washington's Fort McNair Army Base on Saturday, President Barack Obama seemed to approve the tentative deal reached earlier in the day to end the NBA lockout. \n \n When asked about the potential agreement, Obama gave a thumbs-up and said, \"Good deal!\" \n \n \n \n NBA Commissioner David Stern announced Saturday that players and owners appear to have come close to an understanding that could lead to a Christmas Day opener for the basketball season. \n \n But even before that, fans will get a chance to see some pros face off in Washington in mid-December, that is if they're willing to dish out some campaign cash for the president. \n \n A longtime basketball fan, Obama is slated to host the \"First Ever Obama Classic\" on December 12, a fundraiser featuring current and former NBA players. Some big names have already signed up, including Boston Celtics' guard Ray Allen and New York Knicks' forward Carmelo Anthony. \n \n Other players include Patrick Ewing, Blake Griffin and Dwight Howard, and two female players: Cheryl Miller and Tina Thompson. More players will be added before the event, according to the Obama campaign. \n \n The president will attend the Oregon State vs. Towson basketball game in Maryland Saturday afternoon. ||||| As the talk starts to build of all the little concessions the NBA players got in the last week to make an NBA labor deal happen in time for games on Christmas day, remember this: \n \n The owners won. \n \n In a massive way. This is an Attila the Hun sweeping through Eastern Europe kind of win — devastating and total. \n \n David Stern and the owners came into these NBA labor talks saying they lost more than $300 million last season and $400 million the year before that. By getting the players to agree to what is in practice a 50/50 split of basketball related income (although the deal allows the players to get to 51 percent if revenue increases enough) the owners got the players to essentially accept a 12 percent salary cut that will cover those losses. \n \n This will come to more than $3 billion back in the owners’ pockets if the deal lasts the full 10 years (both sides can opt out of the deal after six years). What’s more, the deal means the players will have shorter contracts with lower raises going forward. Plus, the system now ties the hands of larger market, bigger spending teams helping depress salaries that way. \n \n The owners will tell you they didn’t get everything they wanted, some will vote against this deal. Those guys are fools — they got more than enough to balance their books. Combined with more robust revenue sharing — soon to be triple what it was — small market owners should be able to break even or turn a profit. They should be able to compete (they could before, ask San Antonio and Oklahoma City). If they can’t, well, it’s on them now. It’s not the system. \n \n All that said, the players got enough small victories — and a couple key ones — that this is a deal they can live with. \n \n Early in the lockout, PBT spoke with former NBA players union president Charles Grantham and he said the smartest move the union ever made, the thing they could not give up in these talks, was keeping the salary cap tied to league revenue. Early offers from the owners wanted to detach the two — players salaries would stay flat at about $2 billion a year and all of the money from expected growth in the league (such as a new national television deal coming in 2016) would go straight to the owners pockets. \n \n The players won that fight. They will get a smaller share of that revenue, but as the league’s revenue grows player salaries will go up. Grow the game and grow how much money you make. \n \n The other two hills the players were willing to die on were guaranteed contracts and a hard salary cap. The owners relented on those as well. Yes, the owners now have more ways to get out of bad contracts faster, and yes the new luxury tax rules make it much more costly for high-revenue teams to spend big, but the players won those fights on principle. \n \n There were other small victories, such as getting the threshold to get to the 51 percent of revenue lowered to a makeable goal. The players got the extend-and-trade so their biggest stars can better control their exits from teams. They got a solid mid-level exception for tax paying teams. \n \n That was enough. It needed to be enough because the players were going to start losing more money in salary than they were making back fighting over the scraps of this deal. \n \n But this negotiation was all about the money, and the owners got a lot more of it. They won. The small market owners in particular should now be able to turn a profit. The players got a way to save face at the end but the owner won and won big. \n \n With this caveat… \n \n In 1999, after a lockout that lasted into January, the owners were thought to have won. They got a cap on max salaries, so that there would be no more deals like the one Kevin Garnett and Shaquille O’Neal had gotten. They got a percentage that capped players’ salaries in total at 57 percent. Everyone said the owners won, including the players. \n \n A dozen years later, the owner were crying that the deal was unfair and killing them. You never know how things will play out. And you can bet in 10 years, when this deal formally ends, there will be owners saying what a bad deal this is for them and how it is killing them. Even if the fault is their own management.",
    "summary": "– After a 149-day clash between NBA owners and basketball players that finally ended yesterday, the big winners were definitely the owners, writes Kurt Helin at NBC Sports. The owners reduced player incomes from 57% to 50% of basketball-related income, shortened contract lengths, and stiffened a luxury tax designed to stop big-market teams from spending their way to victory. \"This is an Attila the Hun sweeping through Eastern Europe kind of win—devastating and total,\" he writes. The players scored mostly small victories, maintaining perks like sign-and-trade contracts and mid-level exceptions, rather than breaking new ground. But for the most part, the players just saved a little face, while the owners will save a lot more money. On the other hand, at least one big name apparently likes the deal—President Obama, according to CNN. After playing some ball at Fort McNair Army Base yesterday, Obama gave the NBA agreement a thumbs up, shouting \"Good deal\" at reporters."
