I love reading books on art.
Not just the kind with pretty pictures, either.
But the kind with words.
It baffles me how few of my classes during art school actually had required texts.
Thankfully I was lucky enough to stumble into the world of art books on my own, and I believe I’m a better artist for it.
Here are ten books that I sincerely believe every artist out there should purchase and read—at least once.
Art & Fear: If you’ve ever started to have thoughts in your head about whether you are talented enough or why you should bother making art, then you need to read this book.
You also need to read this book if you haven’t had those thoughts yet.
It’s a quick read and very enjoyable.
I don’t think any book will get you back to your easel faster than this one.
The Art Spirit:
Sometimes I read too many books on technique, so I like to balance it out with some theory and emotion.
Robert Henri’s The Art Spirit is a classic.
You won’t find out the best way to draw anime in this book, but you might just discover why you’re making art in the first place.
How Pictures Work: It’s small, simple, and entirely profound.
In my opinion the single best book on composition available.
The illustrations are all made with cut paper, so all frills are left aside, leaving only pure design and composition.
Molly Bang uses a number of comparison pictures to show you how design actually works.
You can probably sit down and read it in one go, but you’ll find yourself returning to it time and time again.
Imaginative Realism: Though this might, at first glance, seem to lean heavily towards the genre illustrators in our midst, this book is great for artists of all types.
James Gurney is a phenomenal painter and an equally fantastic teacher.
He writes clearly and to the point.
No matter what sort of art you want to do, I think you’ll find something pertinent in here.
Color and Light: This is James Gurney’s second book, and it’s easily as good as the first.
I’ve done quite a lot of searching for good books on color and light and didn’t find anything useful enough to recommend… until this.
James Gurney has done extensive research into how light and color work in the real world and how it applies to art.
He balances the scientific understanding with artistic flare in the most eloquent way possible.
And while I’m on the subject let me recommend these two DVDs put out by Gnomon: The Mechanics of Color and Practical Light and Color.
Both helped me enormously when it came to learning color theory.
Hawthorne on Painting: Short and sweet.
A small bite-sized book with tons of little nuggets of wisdom.
It can be a little off-putting in its format (mostly transcribed critiques of images, but without the images), but it’s worth it.
Some people also find it a little wishy-washy and not solidly academic enough, but I find it completely refreshing and hopeful.
I don’t think any other book has been able to instill quite the passion for painting that this book exudes.
Alla Prima: Written by one of the most influential living artists, Alla Prima is an essential tome of observational painting.
Richard Schmid can, at times, come across as all-knowing to some people, but he does so with a fair bit of justification.
His own skills at painting are incredible and he does a remarkably good job at putting everything into words.
It’s the priciest book on this list, but it’s worth every penny.
Oil Painting Techniques and Materials: It can feel a little dated at times—like when Harold Speed talks about the new brush known as the filbert—but it’s a timeless book.
Anyone starting out painting and looking for guidance should pick this up.
The more advanced readers can find some equally useful techniques as well.
The Practice and Science of Drawing: Also written by Harold Speed, this is a classic drawing book.
It covers design as well, but all through the lens of drawing.
Since drawing is the basis for all that we artists do, it makes sense to do a little reading on the subject.
He said he had had it and would no longer encourage aspiring artists to attend art school.
He added that unless someone received a full ride scholarship or had wealthy parents, art school was a waste of money.
He mentioned he had diplomas from the best public and private art schools in the nation and a successful career.
He expressed sadness and shame over art schools exploiting students, noting graduates were poorly prepared and burdened with massive debt.
He cited RISD’s four-year cost at $245,816, comparing it to Harvard Law’s $236,100.
He called this embarrassing and shameful, arguing art schools deceived students into believing it was a smart decision.
He emphasized artists don’t earn six-figure salaries like doctors or lawyers, though livable or comfortable incomes were possible.
He noted a debt calculator suggested $400,000 annually to repay RISD debt in ten years.
He urged people not to start careers with crippling debt.
He begged them to think carefully about paying $3,000 monthly for a decade.
He suggested alternatives, stating college wasn’t necessary for art.
He claimed no job required his diploma, and the work mattered most.
He highlighted affordable atelier schools worldwide and online resources, noting access to global artists and educational content for under a few thousand dollars.
He proposed a plan: the $10k Ultimate Art Education, offering quality education for less than a quarter of RISD’s tuition.
He concluded that now is a great time to be an artist but urged careful consideration of options, warning student loans were unforgivable and could ruin financial futures.
He encouraged finding another path to preserve art’s beauty without debt.
