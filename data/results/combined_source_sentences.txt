Shelly Sterling said she would fight the NBA's decision to ban her estranged husband.
She also mentioned she planned to eventually divorce Donald Sterling but had not yet done so due to financial reasons.
NBA Commissioner Adam Silver urged owners to force Sterling to sell the team, though no decisions had been made about his family.
Sterling spoke to Barbara Walters, and ABC News shared excerpts from their conversation.
Shelly Sterling said today she would eventually divorce her estranged husband, Donald Sterling, and that she would absolutely fight to keep her stake in the Los Angeles Clippers if the NBA forced her to sell.
She told ABC News' Barbara Walters she would fight the decision, asking if a wife of an owner who made racist remarks would be ousted or left in place.
Sterling added that the Clippers are her passion and legacy to her family.
She emphasized her 33 years with the team through its ups and downs.
These comments came two weeks after NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Donald Sterling for life and fined him $2.5 million over racist remarks caught on tape.
Sterling said she would accept whatever punishment the NBA imposed on her husband but insisted her stake in the team should remain separate.
She expressed shock at his actions, saying she did not understand why she should be punished for his behavior.
An NBA spokesman stated that league rules would not allow Shelly to retain her share, explaining that if a controlling owner’s interest is terminated, all other owners’ interests would also be terminated.
Her lawyer, Pierce O’Donnell, disputed the NBA’s interpretation, arguing that California and U.S. law should override the league’s rules.
Sterling said she does not know what Donald will do if forced to sell his share but hopes he might transfer full ownership to her.
She mentioned she has not discussed the matter with him.
She laughed about planning to file for divorce, noting she had signed a petition but postponed it due to financial and legal advice.
She suggested the divorce delay stemmed from financial arrangements.
She also mentioned she believes her husband may be suffering from the onset of dementia.
Several celebrities, including Oprah Winfrey and Magic Johnson, have expressed interest in buying the team, though Sterling remains the owner.
Silver named Richard Parsons as interim CEO of the Clippers, but no decisions on ownership or forced sales have been made.
ABC News contacted Donald Sterling for comment but he declined to respond.
